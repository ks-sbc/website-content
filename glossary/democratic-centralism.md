 Democratic Centralism (DemCent) is the operational principle for how communists organize. It can be summed up in the slogan, "Freedom of Criticism, Unity of Action." DemCent consists of these two primary aspects.

Internally to a communist organization, criticism is encouraged by all comrades. Lively debates are expected, and comrades have a freedom to air their views *even when those views belong to the extreme minority*. The goal of such debates is not to promote a cultish atmosphere or stifle dissent, but rather to dig to the root of a contradiction and arrive at a unity. Candidates are permitted and encouraged to participate in this debate, even though they are not full members. This is what is meant by "Freedom of Criticism."

 When these issues are raised internally, then after a reasonable period of debate in which all comrades have provided their thoughts, a vote is cast by all cadres. **While candidates reserve the right to criticism, they do not have a right to a formal vote.** The majority vote of cadres determines the fate of the decision. Once that decision is considered binding. That is to say, ***even if a dissenting minority loses the vote, they are still bound to uphold that position so long as they are in the organization***. This is what is meant by "Unity of Action".

 After a decision is made, it is never a permanently closed matter. Any comrade may raise the issue ***internally through proper channels*** to be discussed and reassessed at a later date. However, until that time, the decision of the majority is considered binding, and all comrades, cadres and candidates are considered bound to adhere to it. To break away from this would be a breach of discipline.
 
 The spirit behind this is that we ensure our line is determined internally by only those comrades who have agreed to the points of unity. We also want to ensure that democratically mandated decisions are upheld and aren't changed on a whim by the individual judgments of one particularly person. The time to re litigate an issue is at a proper meeting, not in the middle of an action.
