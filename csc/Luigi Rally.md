# Self Criticism of Luigi Mangione Rally
## By Persephone and Gwen

On February 8th, 2025 the KS-SBC hosted a [[MHK Luigi Rally]] which was, by all observable metrics, an objective and abysmal failure. Therefore some self criticism is in order to extract some valid meanings from this.

# What was supposed to happen?

See [[MHK Luigi Rally]] and [[General Meeting 12-28-2024]].

# What actually happened?

At 12:30pm on February 8th, Cde Persephone showed up to the event site at Triangle Park. She sat there for 30 minutes. Nobody except those who were involved in the planning committee showed up to the event at the appointed start time. We waited around for 15 minutes. It was just us so we called it off and decided to hold a meeting to figure out what went wrong and how to avoid it in the future.

# What can be sustained?

- Although the planning itself was clearly wrong, the planning process we still feel is good and detailed. In other words what we need to fix is how we implement it and not the implementation itself.

# What can be improved?
 Based upon the outcome of the meeting, we decide there are two primary errors we made which proved to be fatal.
1. Luigi Mangione is clearly a faddish and hot-button news item. He stayed with the public attention for maybe two weeks then faded from the media attention span. While there are still a lot of memes online about Luigi, it's clear that two months after the fact he is more or less irrelevant in the eyes of the public.

	In our discussion we decided that ***two weeks is the golden time period to act on hot button issues***. If we cannot get an event around a hot topic organized within two weeks of it happening, best not to do anything about it at all.

	We feel it appropriate to mention here that as discussed in [[General Meeting 12-28-2024]] we were opportunistically invited to a liberal rally by someone who we will refer to as OAH. OAH marketed the event to us as "co opting the liberals" and made it sound like this was a great opportunity to get the word about Luigi out. But it's clear in retrospect we were swindled into boosting the attendance of a liberal rally making us look like clowns and fools in the process.
	
	To be clear, the fault is no one but our own for arrogantly thinking we could co opt a liberal event. We take full responsibility for this foolishness and have learned our lesson. However we feel it is still worth formally noting on the record that OAH made a suggestion to our group of an extremely opportunistic and right deviationist character. It is the last time we will consider his assessment of any sort of protests with any degree of seriousness. He has consistently had poor political judgment of an opportunistic and right wing character. Consider this our official stance on the matter.
	
	Originally we wanted to host our rally at that time. While it would have been outside of the two week golden window, a Luigi rally on January 18 would have been way more relevant than on February 8. Alas, being deceived partially by the right opportunism of OAH combined with our own impetuous over eagerness is what led us into this mess.
2. ***Operationally we did not check all the schedules we should have checked.*** We failed to check any kind of athletics calendar such as ESPN or the KSU athletics website. Surely basketball games are planned far in advanced. We could and should have known that our event would conflict with a very popular basketball game, but because we didn't consider this factor in our planning, it went unnoticed.

In summation, moving forward to avoid repeating these mistakes we must:

1. Be sure to check a comprehensive list of all concurrent events, not just Facebook and events.com. in our specific environment of Manhattan this means the KSU sports roster. In college towns more generally, check university athletics.
2. Quit listening to right deviationist opportunists whon consistently have horrible political advice. Their opinion on our affairs and our business is irrelevant!
3. If we're gonna organize anything around the news cycle, it needs to happen within two weeks of the event itself. One week is ideal.
