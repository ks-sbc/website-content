# Criticism and Self-Criticism of our participation in the Topeka State Capitol Rally on January 18, 2025

## Author: Cde Persephone
Written on January 19, 2024

*This following document is a structure Criticism and Self-Criticism of an event which we attended and partially helped organize. We wish to extend our comradely appreciation to the following groups for participating and coordinating with us: **Kansas Communist Party** and **Flint Hills DSA**. We also wish to thank all comrades who, while they could not attend in person, nonetheless were pivotal in the planning and coordination of this event. While we do have some criticisms, we intend these to be of a comradely nature and it is not meant to tear anyone down, but rather to document what we perceive as deficiencies in order to correct them.*

# Criticism

## Liberal nature of event
This criticism and its subheadings are aimed at the various organizations who had speaking opportunities. According to [the events Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3477327632511758/permalink/3620353218209198/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v) the following groups were represented among the speakers:
- Christina Haswood
- Alexis Simmons
- Caleb with Topeka Pride
- Chloe with Loud Light
- Taylor with Planned Parenthood



It's hard to remember who exactly said what because the speeches were flat out uninspiring and more or less all said the same thing. But I think it's safe to say that the words spoken do reflect the organizations mentioned.

Overall, this event was extremely liberal. This is something we all expected going into it, so there is no surprise there. But overall it was bland, uneventful, depressing, monotonous, and in no way inspiring. Every call to action was "Support the democratic party!" Again we expected this at the event. The subheadings below represent some expansions of particularly heinous examples of liberalism.

Since we all knew this was a liberal rally, why did we even bother attending? The reason is because we had a scientific hypothesis that **there would be many people invigorated and energized by a defiant spirit and energy to the Trump regime which will assume power in less than one week.** We sought to find, identify, and reach out to these people and try to channel them into our respective organizations. We wanted to find good-natured people who simply don't know alternatives exist, and offer them an invitation to join something that's actually radical rather than getting sucked into the vortex of liberal electoralism.

We shall get into the results of our scientific hypothesis in [[Topeka State Capitol Rally#Self-Criticism|our self-criticism section]], but to summarize: so far it seems quite successful! We believe that our hypothesis was indeed correct, and that we can refine our behaviors and our organizational tactics to draw in more people.

We don't want to spend too much time on this section, because we feel that those who are most amenable to our messaging probably already understand this on at least some level. So we will simply list the most egregious examples before moving onto other details.

### Flagrant promotion of Zionist agenda
One of the speakers who I believe was from Planned Parenthood, when she was discussing what actions can be taken, had the gall to suggest we 'support "independent" and "critical" media.' Her examples of this resistance media include absolute bourgeois rags such as the Washington Post. Ironically she uttered the slogan "Democracy Dies in Darkness" as she promoted a pay walled newspaper owned by the Zionist billionaire Jeff Bezos, whose Amazon Web Services function as a critical tech infrastructure for the Zionazi military.  The absolute shit rag of a publication that is WaPo whitewashes "israeli" crimes by referring to the Palestinian as the "[Israel-Hamas War](https://www.washingtonpost.com/israel-hamas-war/)". They also have a [dedicated tracker for Israeli hostages](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/hamas-hostages-israel-war-gaza/?itid=sf_world_world_subnav) but not so much as a peel about the more than ten thousand Palestinian hostages in Israeli custody.

The idea that we should characterize any kind of journalism as subversive or to conceive of them as friends, when they are owned by and represent the interests of capitalists, is an insult to the collective intelligence of the people. These newspapers cannot even honestly call it a genocide! To compare them to toilet paper is an insult to Charmin *et al*; these Zionazi propaganda mills are worth less than toilet paper. The entire committee of organizers and every respective organization who endorsed and signed onto this as signatories should be ashamed of themselves for laundering Zionist war crimes.

Furthermore, the point of this rally seemed in large part to serve as an indictment of the GOP. We are in agreement that this group deserves the harshest of critiques! However, not once was Palestine ever mentioned. An ongoing, bipartisan genocide and nary a word! What manner of first-world imperialist chauvinism is this? The rally was advertised as a People's Rally; are the Palestinians being slaughtered by Biden the Butcher (with the consent of the ZioNazi Republicans of course) not people? Of course, we all know the true answer: in the eyes of a Zionist Liberal promoting the Washington Post as a beacon of freedom, Palestinians are subhuman terrorist threats.

### Opportunistic Character of Event
If you wanted a who's-who of [[bylaws#Article VI. Study of Errors]|Opportunists in Kansas organizing and politics]], then the slate of organizations and groups that were front and center here along with the individual politicians who spoke, would be a great place to look! Every single call ot action involved some variations of "Get out the vote!", or "Write to your electeds, who definitely represent the people and who are just like you and me!" Never mind the fact that every politician, Democratic or Republican, is completely owned by the bourgeoisie and that they willingly choose to collaborate with the fascist governing regimes both at the Federal and State levels!

Many of these individual speakers were crying crocodile tears about fascism, portraying Trump as this grave and unique threat when in reality, Trump is more or less a continuation of the fascism fomented under the Biden regime. While there are certain qualitative characteristics which delineate a Biden regime from a Trump regime, being fascist is not one of them. ***Democrats are eager and willing collaborators in the Amerikan fascist state. They proudly work alongside Republicans by "reaching across the aisle"***. This is not a speculation on our part, or any sort of mystery: the politicians and their consent-manufacturing "grassroots organizations" gleefully brag about this collaboration with the Fourth Amerikan Reich!


## One-way communications

For a rally which marketed itself as a "People's March", there was an absolute lack of participation from the people! It seems to us that the organizers only viewed us as empty receptacles into which their liberal propaganda and nonsense could be deposited, akin to the banking model of education described by Paulo Freire in *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*.

What exactly was this rally? To quote a very astute 9 year old girl in attendance who I spoke with, "It looks like everyone is just standing around in a circle while they get talked at by some boring people at the top of the stairs." Due to the inclement weather, the march which was scheduled was cancelled as the presence of icy patches presented a danger to a group march. We do not dispute this decision to cancel the march, so this was probably the one and only prudent decision or call to action made at this rally.

But there was absolutely nothing. We, the people who the rally was supposedly about, had absolutely zero role to play here. It's clear that the structure of this protest very much mimicked what the organizers think about the masses: that were just pawns to vote in the democracy ritual that happens once every couple of years and a fundraising base they can milk.


## Police Collaboration

I was told by someone closer to the organizers that this rally was planned in liaison with the police. To us, this is a completely asinine and stupid decision. Let's get the facts straight here. The organizers want to tell us all how evil and fascist the Trump regime is, and they portray the Christian Nationalists are some existential threat to democracy.[^1]

So, what do the organizers do? Why, of course they go beg permission from the fascists paramilitary police agencies and tell them exactly about our plans! In what fucking galaxy does it make sense to tell the Gestapo that you plan to host an ANTIFA rally opposing Hitler?

To expand upon this criticism in a less snappy fashion: we do not disagree with the organizers' general assessment that the Trump regime represents a grave threat to the rights of LGBTQ people, undocumented migrants, women, oppressed national minorities, Indigenous people, etc. What we disagree upon is that Trump represents a distinct and unique threat. He only represents a different wing of the broader fascist movement -- the revanchist fascists -- as opposed to the Democrats who represent the neoliberal transatlanticist wing of the fascist movement.

In the Democratic party rhetoric heard both today and elsewhere, Trump is portrayed as an existential threat to democracy; they love to characterize him as an "Orange Hitler" or a "Cheeto Benito"[^2]. But an investigation of the facts, which any worker regardless of their knowledge of Marxism could perform, reveals an underlying hypocrisy: if your group truly thinks that Donald Trump is the reincarnation of Adolph Hitler, then why do you think that elections are the path to defeat him? Let us note that Adolph Hitler LOST the popular vote to Hindernburg in the Weimar elections! History proves to us that fascists don't give a rats ass about the ballot box. So why do they think this will stop their alleged Orange Hitler?

On one hand, the liberals argue that we're supposed to think Trump is this existential threat to democracy, that he will throw us into Handmaids Tale or whatever. Again, on this assessment although we don't think Trump is unique, we understand the gravity of the situation and agree! But actions speak louder than words. And so there's a definite schism between empty rhetorical witticisms and the actual behavior of liberals. This disjuncture between thought and action is evident to any worker who really thinks on the matter for more than two minutes.

If these liberals truly, genuinely thought Trump was the reincarnation of Adolph Hitler, why would they be telling us to vote in the Reichstag elections? Why wouldn't they be advocating for the use of every and any methodology and tool available to us to stop this threat? **The reasoning is because their rhetoric is nothing more than hyperbolic puffery and that they truly don't actually feel that way.** The implication is that Democrats and liberals -- the precise people leading this pathetic excuse for a "rally" -- are lying to us. They loathe the very people who they organized a "People's Rally" for, and view us as nothing more than docile sheep that need to be deceived into fulfilling their agenda. Democrats and liberals truly abhor the masses, and think that we are a bunch of morons who need to be swindled and manipulated. What person in their right mind would want to "build power" with such gross, psychologically manipulative and Machiavellian swindlers?

## Confused and Unclear Advertising

![[confused_march.jpg]]

This is marketed as a People's March but also advertised as a Women's March. Ignoring the tacky uterus symbol which well discuss in the next section, the purpose of the rally was unclear. Was this to support women's rights specifically? We agree that women certainly have a lot of things at stake in a Trump administration, but women aren't the only group.

If it's a People's March, then why advertise with signs focus on reproductive organs?

## Transphobic Messaging

![[Screenshot_2025-01-17-14-35-30-27_cbf47468f7ecfbd8ebcc46bf9cc626da.jpg]]

So many things wrong with this! Is the implication supposed to be that womanhood is defined by having a uterus? What about trans men? Non binaries? Do their uteruses count? What about trans women? Are we considered to be women? It sure feels like the organizers don't think so based on this graphic!

It is especially shameful that Topeka Pride was present for this rally, spoke at the rally, and helped organize and plan it. Apparently, despite representing the transgender community they still decided to endorse this. I ask, why? How do you all think this makes trans people feel?

# Self-Criticism

Although there were multiple organizations present of a socialist orientation, the ones involved in planning with KS-SBC were Flint Hills DSA and Kansas Communist Party from Wichita. Therefore this self criticism applies to our book club as well as those specific groups.

## What was supposed to happen?
We had a group planning session a few weeks prior to the event. In this planning session, we determined the political messaging of the event would be:

1. To explicitly spread communist messaging by identifying as communists and winning over the masses by demonstrating correct ideas.
2. To draw people into the book club for the purposes of investigations
3. Spread the pamphlets to educate about what communism even means

We resolved to set ourselves apart from the liberal nature of the event by presenting a radical alternative and by contrasting our messaging to that of the liberal groups.

We also set out to advertise and spread the word of the Luigi Mangione Solidarity Rally in Manhattan planned for next month.

All concerned groups wanted to also try to recruit people, specially those people who are new to organizing and looking for something more ambitious than electoral opportunism. We felt it would be good to rope them into our organizing because that's fundamentally what they would be looking for. A liberal individual who wants to do electoral work would naturally gravitate to the liberals anyways, so we weren't much concerned about them.

We planned to stand together as a group and present an organized front to give off an image of unity in purpose and make our presence as an opposition bloc known.

## What Actually Happened?

There was a mix up in the dates when this was originally brought up in [[2024-12-28-general-meeting|December's general meeting]]. So during the planning meeting we thought it would take place on the 20th of January. But due to a factor outside our control it was moved to the 18th. This affected some folks ability to attend.

We all arrived more or less at the designated start time. We stood in a loose formation and greeted one another as for some of us it was the first time meeting in person. We began by handing out flyers for the Manhattan Luigi Protest as well as the Lawrence Solidarity Fest.

We then stood around and passively absorbed the speeches. Some comrades took photographs for social media of the various organizations. Towards the end, the crowd drew together closer and at that point I started pushing back against the speakers. When the speakers made absurd and patently false claims such as "These legislators are members of our community and they're people like you and I" I would push back shouting "No, they don't represent working people! They only care about the ruling class!" Or when one of the speakers mentioned Washington Post and encouraged the crowd to subscribe to it, I shouted back "No way I'm giving my money to this Zionist rag! They're owned by a billionaire!"

Many folks seemed receptive to this messaging. I had one woman come up to me after the event and tell me "I liked what you were saying a lot, you should have had a speaking role!" She took a flyer and eventually signed up to start attending lessons.

## What can be improved upon?
- None of us are sorcerers and we cannot control the weather but we can control how we dress and prepare for the weather. I made the mistake thinking that Manhattans weather would be basically the same as in Topeka. This was false. Topeka had an extremely frigid wind chill. And so to mitigate this for next time we need to check the weather specifically for the location of the event. We should all bring multiple layers and ensure we have gloves. Bringing hand warmers would also be good.
- During our planning event, there was an agreement that we would attend this rally in an explicitly defined capacity as a communist opposition. We agreed that we'd be there to be a voice of reason, to denounce this crass opportunism. However, it was only KS-SBC members as well as one of their children who were willing to speak up and call out the most egregious claims of the speakers (of which there was no shortage). As organizations in a coalition, we need to be willing to step up to the plate and put ourselves out there in our function as a vanguard[^3].
	- It is unclear what held others back from joining these denunciations. Perhaps it was a fear of being perceived as chauvinistic, or "speaking out of place". While it always good to be aware of positionality and to be cautious against behaving in a chauvinistic fashion, we say: what could possibly be more chauvinistic than promoting Zionist publications? What could be more chauvinistic than integrating with and collaborating with a fascist regime?
	- Maybe it was unclear that we intended to actually step up and push back actively, wanting to take a more passive role. This is comfortable and easy, but the results make it clear that folks are hungry for more. This makes it clear that we need to really be unafraid to not only declare who we are, but to push back against our ideological enemies.
	- We would love to set up a meeting to discuss this matter with any comrades in attendance who were what we shall refer to as a part of the "Red Faction". unfortunately due to the weather, we had to leave a bit early because the cold was starting to hurt physically. But, we still think we should debrief as a collective. So please email or get in touch with us, if you were in our contingent.

## What can be sustained moving forward?
- Empirically, this 'poaching' technique worked. Many people signed up to join our book club after hearing these denunciations and receiving our flyers. As of less than 12 hours after the rally, I see at least 5 who have joined the server and expressed interest in attending lessons. So it's not a matter of if this would lead to isolation and alienation; the results speak for themselves.
- The planning meeting was very thorough, and we came to some great political conclusions. There is room for improvement, specifically aroudn communications regarding specific actions. But, it is clear that our planning paid off based on the results.
- Fraternal bonds between sister organizations. I felt that this planning process and the event itself built solidarity among our groups and increased unity.

[^1]: We actually agree on this point! Where we disagree is that we believe the Democrats are active participants in that fascist regime, and that the organizers are, at best, collaborators with the fascists.
[^2]: The liberal psychology of these clever little quips that try to function as a sharp barb that preserves the overarching regime of capital is a truly fascinating psychological neurosis which should be studied further!
[^3]: We make no claims to be a vanguard party of other sorts. When we address ourselves as a vanguard, we're simply recognizing that as this event, our coalition represents the
