8. The Candidate Cadre will answer questions of a political and ideological nature from the Cadre Organizers. A Secretary from the Cadre Organizers will record minutes of this meeting, taking note of which questions were asked and what the response was. The Cadre will then vote, based upon those answers and the Candidates general conduct, to deny or approve them as a full Cadre Organizer.

Examples of a tangible relationship include living in the Branch community, having a job in the Branch community, organizing locally within the Branch community, or  being a student studying at a local school.
5. The responsibility of a KS-SBC Branch is to conduct political education in accordance with the Points of Unity inside of its territorial jurisdiction. IE the Manhattan Branch will be responsible for educating the masses of Manhattan, while the Lawrence Branch will be responsible for educating the masses of Lawrence.
6. Branches **may not** form their own unique curriculums. They will teach lessons from the curriculum democratically decided upon by all Organizers on a state level. However, branches *may* choose which parts of the curriculum they want to teach at a given time. For example, Manhattan may decide to study the issue of the Black Nation while Lawrence may want to study the error of *eclecticism*.
7. For those comrades and community members who live in a smaller, more isolate Kansas community, all in-person lessons of branches shall be rebroadcast via Discord at a minimum as technology permits. If individuals in person are comfortable with and consent to being recorded, then Branches shall record their lessons either on video or audio-only, with the intent to republish them to social media such as YouTube.

# Points of Unity
---
## Article I. Ideology
1. We are dedicated to the study of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought (ML-MZT), and the science of socialist revolution. We read this theory not as an idle hobby, but as an instruction manual to change society.
2. Marxism-Leninism is a living body of revolutionary theory and method; it is the culmination of revolutionary experience from the whole history of the class struggle. Mao Zedong added the next stage of development to the theory of Marxism-Leninism by way of the Mass Line and the theory of Protracted People's War.
3. We shall take ideological and practical guidance from the relevant experiences and contributions of revolutionaries from every land and region. We place special emphasis upon studying the works of revolutionaries in the imperial periphery to learn from them as peers and equals.
4. We recognize and affirm the importance of revolutionary thought and class struggle in all things. For this reason, the KS-SBC takes an avowedly anti-revisionist stance.
## Article II. Self-Determination
1. We agree that all peoples have the right to national self-determination. 
2. The universal realization of that right within and without the existing U.S. empire and its junior partner Canada, that is, the decolonization of North America, is a precondition for a just society.
3. The anti-colonial and national liberation struggles constitute a special stage of the social revolution.
4. These struggles include the liberation and self-emancipation of the Black nation of New Afrika, all pre-Colombian Indigenous peoples, Hawaiian people, and the U.S. Empire’s colonial territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, etc).
5. We support unconditionally the right of colonized people anywhere in the world to conduct their liberation struggles how best they see fit. Our job is not to chastise them or to tell them how to struggle. Our role within the imperialist core is to engage in dialog with the oppressed, treat them as equals and Comrades, and inquire as to how we can best serve their struggles.
6. We recognize that in the specific context of the United States that ***settler colonialism is the primary contradiction with which we must contend.*** Our studies shall reflect our priorities ideologically, ensuring that we center the study of settler-colonialism and anti-colonial liberation movements in our work.
## Article III. Queer and Gender Liberation
1. This group recognizes patriarchy as the oldest form of oppression, and furthermore understands that queer and transgender liberation are inseparably bound with the feminist struggle. In that spirit, we shall study revolutionary materialist feminist theory and work to enumerate and expand it.
2. The materialist feminist theory shall be distinguished from the reformist and unscientific feminist trends by: (i) recognition of gendered oppression as structural and (ii) recognition of the failure of reforms to bring about true emancipation. It also recognizes the validity of resistance to oppression by these groups.
3. We recognize and acknowledge publicly that ***what is happening in Kansas with Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming individuals is rightly classified as an ongoing genocide.***
4. Therefore we affirm our steadfast commitment to study the topics of queer and transgender liberation as they apply to the particular context of Kansas.
## Article IV. Disability Liberation
1. We uphold the abolition of disability as a social structure and the liberation of disabled persons is a vital component of the social revolution.
2. We also recognize that disabled people fill a disproportionate amount of inmates and prisoners within the US prison system. This is a form of not only extreme labor exploitation and oppression, but also as a form of eugenics and social control.
3. This Group shall ensure that disabled comrades and members are included and empowered to participate in all branches of the Group’s work and study by offering accessibile accommodations when possible.
4. We recognize the COVID-19 pandemic as an ongoing public health crisis and mass disabling event. We also acknowledge that the abject failure of the US government at all levels – to include Kansas and every locality within – is an acute manifestation of the ruling classes inability to see the proletariat as anything except an expendable resource.
5. Therefore, in solidarity with disabled people as well as out of a sense of self preservation, this group commits to offering remote participation options as well as requiring the use of masks at all indoors events. It shall be on the group to provide masks for any community members who do not have them.
## Article V. Anti-Imperialism
1. We stand firmly opposed to the world-system of imperialism. Imperialism creates a parasitic relationship between the global north -- represented primarily by the NATO bloc -- and the exploited global south based on unequal exchange, unbalanced development, military force and financialization.
2. Given the special relationship which Kansas maintains with the Armed Forces of the United States, we affirm our opposition to the US world imperialist system in the strongest of terms. We refuse to compromise on this, and understand that the greatest way that we Americans can contribute to liberation abroad is to do whatever we can to fight empire at home.
3. This group will commit to studying the imperialist armed forces, paying particular attention as to how the repressive strategies forged abroad are unleashed domestically. The intent behind this is to eventually develop a theory of the US Military which can aid Kansas activists on effective antiwar and anti militarist activism which has a meaningful impact, while serving and centering the colonized outside our borders.
## Article VI. Study of Errors
1. This group is committed to improving the state of the socialist movement in Kansas through a rigorous and scientific analysis of its mistakes. At the time of this documents writing, those errors can broadly be classified as **Opportunism, Eclecticism**, and **Tailism.**
2. This group shall make a special effort to study those errors and educate all people about why they are harmful and how they can be corrected. This group affirms it's commitment to helping any groups identify these errors and also working with them to produce solutions.
3. The errors in section 1 , shall be reassessed on a quarterly basis for relevance and applicability. They may be changed with a simple majority vote after allowing for an appropriate period of debate.
4. By **Tailism** we mean the error of uncritically following whatever popular sentiment happens be at the time. By **Opportunism** we mean compromising on revolutionary principles in order to secure short term gains. By **Eclecticism** we mean a lack of ideological rigor and having a “big tent” approach of picking and choosing different unrelated parts of ideologies in an incoherent manner.
