# What Is A Provocateur

Have you ever been to a rally or protest and seen an adventurist and what they do? They usually have wildly out of place calls for extreme actions that don't match the mood of the crowd. For example it could be a demonstration that was explicitly advertised and planned by organizers as a peaceful march. And then along comes some guy (and it almost always is a guy, usually white) talking about the armed struggle, how we need to be more extreme, etc. Those questions are absolutely things we should be talking about, but there's a time and a place. See **[[Glossary of Marxism#Agent Provocateur|Agents Provocateur]]** for more details.

It's important to note that while Malinovsky certainly includes the contemporary definition of Agents Provocateur in his book, he isn't specifically talking only about those ones. Rather, we should interpret his discussion of Agents Provocatuer as discussing police infiltration more broadly.

Serge quotes directly from an Okrahna document titled **Directive on the Secret Service**. This direct quote reads, "The Political Police must prepare to destroy the revolutionary centres at the moment their activity is greatest and not allow their work to be diverted by dwelling on secondary undertakings." Serge summarizes by saying "So the principle is: ***let the movement develop, the better to liquidate it later on.***"

# Qualities of a Police Informant

The Okrahna write the folllowing observations about who they feel makes an ideal informant:

1. Revolutionaries of weak character, those disillusioned with or aggrieved at the party, those living in poverty, those who have escaped from places of exile[^1] or are under sentence of exile
2. Revolutionaries living in poverty who, without renouncing their convictions, agree out of necessity to hand over information
3. Placing informers among prisoners is extremely useful.
4. So far as possible, have several collaborators in each organisation. The service must direct its collaborators, not be directed by them.

In summation, Serge writes:

> This brings us to the question of the psychology of the provocateur. It is certainly a morbid psychology, but that should not surprise us unduly. We have seen, in the Okhrana’s Directive, what kind of people the police “work on” and what methods they use. Someone like Serova, considered a weak character, living in poverty, works courageously as a party member. She is arrested. Abruptly torn out of her normal existence, she feels lost. Forced labour awaits her, perhaps the gallows. Or else she could say a word, just one word, about someone who actually had done her some wrong ... She hesitates. An instant of cowardice is enough; and there is plenty of cowardice in the depths of a human being.
> 
> But there are not only people who are agents out of _cowardice_; there are, much more dangerously, those dilettantes and adventurers who believe in nothing, indifferent to the ideal they have been serving, taken by the idea of danger, intrigue, conspiracy, a complicated game in which they can make fools of everyone. They may have talent, their role may be almost undetectable. ... The illegal revolutionary – above all the terrorist – acquires a terrible cast of mind, a formidable will, daring, love of danger. If then, following a common shift of mentality, under the influence of petty personal experiences – failures, disillusionment, intellectual deviations – or of temporary defeats of the movement, it turns out that he loses his _idealism_, what is to become of him? If he really is strong, he will steer clear of neuroticism and suicide; but in some cases he may become a faithless adventurer, to whom all means seem good to attain his personal ends.

# Behaviors of Informants

Recall Serge's summation of the political police's mission as "let the movement develop, the better to liquidate it later on." How do informants play into this goal?

Firstly, and most importantly, their mission is to gather information and collect intelligence. Much of what they collect is not even related to law breaking or criminal activity, although that is certainly some of what they do. We will discuss this more in the next section. But generally speaking, they collect information with an eye towards mapping out the revolutionary movement and identifying key players.

Another behavior of informants is to achieve important positions in organizations that are conducive to the collection of intelligence. In particular, informants aim for positions such as secretary or treasurer. These positions are very labor intensive, and they are not prestigious. Glory-seekers and egotists want to be the center of attention, so they'd rather be someone like a president of the group, or a spokesperson. Furthermore, administrative duties are often female-coded and so misogyny plays a role in this as well. This has happened recently in Colorado Springs DSA, where an undercover cop was able to thoroughly saturate the group by [becoming its secretary](https://theintercept.com/2023/03/21/fbi-colorado-springs-surveillance/).

And finally, even though their primary concern is not the law enforcement, political police love to receive report any kinds of crimes done by revolutionaries. IT makes their job all the easier.

# The Case of Malinovsky

Serge talks about Malinovsky and this is an important thing to discuss. Malinovsky is one of the most important examples to understand of infiltrators in Communist history.

In summary, Roman Malinovsky was the most highly paid and highest ranking agent of the Okrahna. He was able to rise through the ranks of the Bolsheviks and eventually get onto the central committee of the Communist Party. He had been a collaborator of the police since 1902, and joined the RSDLP[^4] in 1906. From the very first days of the RSDLP, Malinovsky was infiltrating. He still managed to rise through the ranks and become a well regarded Communist. He was so adept at being an agent that he impressed Vladimir Lenin and won his confidence.[^5] At the height of his revolutionary career, he made it into the Duma representing the Bolshevik faction.

Despite this, the Bolsheviks were still able to triumph. The Russian Revolution was a success in spite of the Okrahna's staggering efforts. Why? Serge writes,

> But in Russian society in the last years of the *ancien regime*, the new, subversive ideas had acquired irresistible force. Everyone in the working class, the petty bourgeoisie, the army and the navy, the liberal professions – everyone among them who acted and thought, was a revolutionary, that is, a “socialist” of some kind. There was no satisfied middle bourgeoisie as in the countries of Western Europe. The *ancien regime* was no longer really defended by anyone except the upper clergy, the court nobility, the financiers, and a few politicians, in other words, by a very small aristocracy. Revolutionary ideas therefore found fertile soil everywhere. Over a long period, the nobility and the bourgeoisie gave the flower of their youth to the revolution. When a revolutionary went into hiding, he found many spontaneous, disinterested, devoted helpers. When he was arrested it happened more and more frequently that the soldiers in charge of conveying him sympathized with him, and among the jailers he almost found “comrades”.

			2. Projecting the intentions of the superstructure onto the technology IE a kidn of fetishism.
			3. 
2. Why is fedjacketing[^3] so harmful to movements? How do we handle people we have legitimate and objective evidence of being an informer in a way that's not fedjacketing.
	1. Malinovsky example: Even if he were a cop (an dhe was), we were structured
		1. What are actions we can do that can't be co-opted?

			2. "Don't allow the oppressor c"
	2. Opsec

5. Lenin once said of Malinovsky, "If he is a provocateur, the police gained less from him than our Party did." What do you think Lenin meant by this?
6. In your own words, how were the Bolsheviks able to triumph in spite of their saturation with spies and informers? What implications does this have for organizing in the US?
7. What kind of information in particular do you think might be valuable to police? In particularly, information that's not direct evidence of a crime? Why would this information be helpful to the police to know?

[^1]: The Okrahna and the Tsarist state had a practice of deporting revolutionaries to live in exile in Siberia, instead of locking up revolutionaries in a prison where they could spread the message to others. This did not work out very well.
[^2]: We should not exile someone just because they choose to use drugs. This breeds resentment 
[^3]: The frivolous and baseless accusation that someone is a cop, or an informer.
[^4]: Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. The predecessor to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, contested by two major factions: Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.
[^5]: It is important to note that Comrade Stalin disagreed with Lenin on his assessment of Malinvosky. Comrade Stalin correctly suspected that Malinovsky was an Okrahna spy. Bukharin, despite his many errors, also correctly identified Malinovsky as an agent.
