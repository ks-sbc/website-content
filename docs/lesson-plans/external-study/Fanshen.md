Chapter 13
1. **Educational Shift Toward Class Consciousness**: In January 1946, young revolutionary cadres attended a meeting aimed at fostering a deep understanding of class dynamics. Discussions addressed fundamental issues like why the poor remained poor while the rich prospered, and whether it was justifiable to pay rent to landlords. These conversations built a foundation for questioning and ultimately challenging feudal practices.

2. **Critique of Landlords' Exploitative Practices**: The chapter recounts grievances voiced by peasants, who described how landlords exploited them through unfair labor expectations, forced services, and manipulative financial practices. For example, landlords would use small measures when dispensing grain to peasants and larger measures when collecting rent. This exploitation extended beyond economics to personal lives, as landlords exerted control over peasants' families, often engaging in abusive behaviors.

3. **Rejection of Feudal Justifications**: Many peasants, even as they denounced exploitative practices, initially struggled with the notion of fully abolishing the land rent system. However, through debates and examples, they were encouraged to see rent itself as a form of exploitation, unjustified by any legitimate contribution from landlords.

4. **Party's Leadership and Mao's Influence**: Mao Zedong’s teachings were central in guiding the campaign, emphasizing the need to move beyond personal revenge against individual landlords to a broader struggle against the entire feudal structure. This campaign symbolized the recommencement of China’s land revolution, reinforcing Mao’s predictions of a powerful peasant uprising aimed at systemic change.
   
5. **Engaging the Senses**: The Communist cadres displayed rotten grain and hoarded salt at a public meeting as physical evidence of the landlords’ neglect and greed. This was another form of political education. How did this tangible display of wasted resources affect the peasants' understanding of landlord exploitation?
   
Chapter 14
1. **Wang Lai-hsun’s Trial and Public Reckoning**: Wang Lai-hsun faces accusations and resentment from the peasants, particularly from his family members whom he exploited or betrayed. This is exemplified by his treatment of Wang Ch’ung-lai’s wife, who returned to Long Bow hoping for justice but faced initial skepticism from local cadres. Her testimony against Wang Lai-hsun in a public meeting symbolizes the personal and collective grievances held against him.
2. **Intensification of Class Struggle**: The trial reveals the depth of suffering endured by the peasants under the landlord class. Through testimonies and heated exchanges, peasants describe Wang Lai-hsun's harsh treatment, including how he turned family members into beggars during difficult times. These public confrontations amplify class consciousness among the villagers, emphasizing a break from the old feudal power dynamics.
3. **Communist Influence and Maoist Ideology**: Mao's famous quote, "A revolution is not the same as inviting people to dinner... it cannot be anything so restrained and magnanimous," opens the chapter, underscoring the radical and often violent nature of social change as promoted by the Communist Party. This sets the ideological tone, justifying the intense emotions and actions of the peasants as they confront figures like Wang Lai-hsun who represent the old order.
