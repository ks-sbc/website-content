## An Educational Pamphlet written by Organizers of the Kansas Socialist Book Club

Over time, the attitude of the people in the United States has changed on the subject of Palestine. Where as most Americans used to be unconditional supporters of Israel, now many are beginning to see the truth. They rightly recognize that what Israel is doing since October 7th is a genocide. But, this understanding is still incomplete.

Something like 60% of Americans support a ceasefire. Even among the right-wing Republican Party, a majority of Republicans and conservatives still support a ceasefire. This is a development which positively demonstrates growth and a change of consciousness. However, it is not enough. What our book club wants to educate people in Kansas on, is that in addition to supporting a ceasefire demand, Kansans should also wholeheartedly support the right of Palestinians to engage in armed resistance against the Israeli occupier.

# Why Is A Ceasefire Demand Not Enough?
![[images-1 1.jpg]]
*A protestor holds up a home-made sign which reads "Ceasefire Now" painted in the colors of the Palestinian flag.*

To be clear, the emergence of the popularity of a ceasefire demand is a positive and welcome change among Kansans. But a ceasefire alone, which doesn't confer the right of Palestinians to continue their armed struggle, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of
the situation that affects the Palestinian people.

Let's consider a hypothetical example to demonstrate why. Imagine one night, that you are home with your family and a burglar breaks in. They start trashing the place, stealing your family heirlooms, and physically beating your children. You call the police, but the police side with the burglar. In fact, the police actually inform you that you are being evicted so that the burglar can move into your home. In this scenario, would you say it's reasonable to defend yourself? Do you think you'd be justified in fighting back against the burglar? What about resisting against the police who gave away your home? In a nutshell, the scenario I described played it out millions of times over the past century in Palestine. The burglars in this scenario are called **Israelis**. Much like their American counterparts, Israelis belong to an economic class called **settlers**. The Nation-State of Israel rests on a foundation of systemic burglary called **settler-colonialism**. This system of settler-colonialism is of the same variety as in America, where American settlers exterminated the
Indigenous nations to acquire their land. Where we live, that would be the Kanza Nation.

# How Did This All Start?

After the defeat of the Ottoman empire in World War 1, the British Empire decided to claim Palestine as it's own territory. The Zionist movement to create a **Jewish ethnostate** -- a system of government based on the domination and privilege of one
ethnicity over all others -- was an up and coming political ideology which already had its eyes set upon colonizing Palestine. Therefore, the British created what was known as **Mandatory Palestine** by way of the **Balfour Declaration of 1917**. Although Jewish people had historically lived in Palestine for centuries in relative harmony with Palestinian Christians and Muslims, the British wanted to expand their empire by means of the **settler-colonial** system. So they decided to empower the nascent Zionist movement with funding and weapons to begin the process of settling Mandatory Palestine as an extension of the British Empire.

The Zionist settlers used their particular interpretation of the Jewish faith as a means of getting buy-in from the workers and small business owners (proletariat and petit-bourgeoisie) in addition to promises of their own parcels of land. Although the **material base** motivation for Zionist colonization was control of the land by the Zionists on behalf of the British Empire, the **ideological superstructure** motivation for this colonization was a perverse reinterpretation of Judaism. It was understood in such a way that the Jewish homeland of Zion just so happened to be in Palestine which they were entitled to by divine decree.

Although Nazi Germany seems like a nonsense comparison to the Zionist project, there are many parallels both historically and ideologically. The Nazis, much like the Zionists, wanted to turn Eastern Europe and Russia into settler-colonies of the Third Reich. And historically, the fascist German movement had close ties with the fascist Zionist movement. One such example of this is the **Haavara Agreement**, in which the Nazi state agreed that in exchange for conceding any wealth they have, it would instead deport some Jewish people to Mandatory Palestine to be taken in by the Zionist colonizers. The Zionists agreed to this deal. Their reasoning was brutal self-interest. The logic went that if all of Europe were a hostile hotbed of antisemitism, then European Jews
would have no choice but to flee to Palestine and join the Zionist Movement for protection.

The Zionists also borrowed many of the terrorist tactics used by the Nazis against the Jewish people in Germany. One striking example is the **Kristallnacht**, an episode where the Nazi state gave permission to Germans to loot businesses owned by, steal
property from, and murder Jews in a state-sanctioned pogrom. The Zionist version of the **Kristallnacht** is known as the **Nakba**, which means Catastrophe in Arabic. During the Nakba, the Zionist movement ransacked Palestinian villages, murdered Palestinian
civilians, and looted Palestinian businesses in much the same was as the Nazis did to the Jews of Germany.

## A Clash of Zionist Ideals

Eventually, there was conflict between the various strands of Zionism. Although they had some slight differences of ideology, they remain united by ***their belief that European Jews are entitled to colonize Palestinian lands***. Their disagreements were focused
primarily on what the ideal methodology for such colonization is. Some strains of Zionism such as Labor Zionism - the ideology of the Founding Father of Israel *David Ben-Gurion* - advocated for the formation of Israel through communal farms that would build socialism. This is a laughable idea, because socialism stands in firm opposition to all forms of colonialism.

Other Zionist philosophies took a more aggressive approach. The most extreme Zionists were called Revisionist Zionists. They believed that the path to building an Israeli state lies in seizing as much land as quickly as possible, no matter the cost in blood. The current ruling-class factions in Israel to which Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party belong can trace their ideological development back to the most radical factions of Revisionist Zionism: Lehi and Irgun. These organizations were so extreme that they proudly self-
identified as terrorists, and were known for committing massacres where they would throw babies into ovens and force Palestinians to dig their own graves before shooting them.

Although the Labor Zionism faction eventually won out in the short term, its victory would not have been possible without the bloodshed and terrorism of the Revisionist Zionist ideology. These bloodthirsty warmongering ideals are not a deviation or an error, but rather a built-in feature inherent to not only Zionism, but to all forms of settler-colonialism. It is the reason why nearly eight decades after the State of Israel was officially formed, that the Revisionist Zionists have emerged victorious from intra-colonizer
conflict.

# The Mechanics Of Settler Colonialism

This is because settler colonialism is always, in every single form, an inherently genocidal philosophy. On a theoretical and material level, when we set aside all of the ideological window dressing, Settler Colonialism is about the appropriation of land from an Indigenous nation(s) into the control of a population of settlers. The method by which this is done, is through the eradication and genocide of the Indigenous population who are replaced with a settler population. The settlers, coming from all types of class backgrounds *to include the working class*, are offered a bargain by the imperialist bourgeoisie. In exchange for their service as settlers clearing the land of the Indigenous people and bringing the land into the relations of capitalist production, the settlers would be given a small chunk of that land to claim as their own. This material dynamic of exchanging land for genocidal services is the foundational bargain upon which settler colonialism is founded.

Two things are important to note about settler colonialism, which have already been touched upon but need to be restated in explicit terms. The first fact about settler colonialism as a system is that ***although it always rests on a foundation of ideology - whether that be American exceptionalism or Jewish Zionism - the fundamental driving force behind the settler colonial system is one of the ownership and control of the land and its wealth.*** This is important to note, because the science of **historical materialism** teaches us that material factors such as who owns land, are the
primary driving force of history. This is in opposition to the philosophy of **idealism**, which argues that it is ideas and Great Men of History (tm) who are the driving force.

The second takeaway is that **settler colonialism is not a single event, but rather a continuous process of displacement, extermination, and theft**. Often times, liberals and even some socialists will say something along the lines of “Settler colonialism was definitely a problem, but that’s all in the past now. It’s over, and the settlers are here to stay.” This is both extremely racist against Indigenous people, as well as factually incorrect. As evidenced by Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7th, 2023 we can clearly see that the genocidal process of settler colonialism is an ongoing thing. It follows a similar pattern to that in the United States, where the poisoning of the Hawaiian nations water supply and the building of oil pipelines through Standing Rock Sioux territory are contemporary examples of settler colonialism here in the United States. It never finishes or completes. It only varies in degrees of maturity of the process. The United States can be said to be the
most mature settler colony in world history.

# Conclusion: What Is To Be Done?

Given the brief survey of Palestinian history, hopefully it is clear that merely calling for a ceasefire is not sufficient. A ceasefire, while it would be a welcome step, is not the end-all be-all because ***it merely represents a return to the slow, simmering genocide as opposed to its current phase of a roaring fire***. The only just political solution, from an ethical and practical standpoint, **is to support the people of Palestine in their resistance by whatever means necessary**. This genocide will not end, and Palestine will not be free, until the time that the genocidal State of Israel is smashed into a thousand pieces and scattered to the wind.

Palestinians and Americans have both tried a variety of tactics. They've done peaceful marches, silent vigils, written their representatives and voting on local resolutions to symbolically chastise Israel. Although there have been some minor successes, such as the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement, American bombs are still dropping over Palestine, and American tax money is funding Israeli genocide. As the famous saying goes, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. So that begs the question: what is to be done?

Firstly, we must get organized. And in order to get organized, we have to study revolutionary theory. We need to study theory and history to see what past movements have done to successfully dismantle racist ethnostates and extend material solidarity to the oppressed. The German resistance to Nazism, the Communist resistance to South African Apartheid, and our own American resistance to the Vietnam War offer some potent examples. But above all else, we must escalate. What that looks like difffers for
each person, but it’s safe to say that whatever you can do and have the means to do, it would be justified in pursuit of stopping a genocide. We ask ourselves “What would we do if we were alive in Nazi Germany? Well, what you would have done is what you’re
doing today.
