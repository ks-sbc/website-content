## Session Structure (2 Hours)

### Lecture Component (30 minutes)

1. Historical Context

2. Core Concepts
   - Unity is important, but ***it has to be principled***.
   - Communists are among the first to be targeted by fascism. Therefore we need underground durable structures.
   - An underground that runs parallel to the above ground movement and works in tandem is a must to fight and survive fascism.
   - 

3. Modern Parallels

       - Immigration
       - Looting the economy

   - Local relevance
       - Trans genocide in Kansas
       - Kansas ties to imperialism
       - ICE raids

### Group Discussion (80 minutes)

#### Discussion Topics

##### Historical Erasure of Communism

###### Contemporary Relevance:

- We see communist history being glossed over or erased all the time. Example: World War 2
- Liberals retroactively take credit and also gloss over bourgeois crimes
- Another example: Everyone forgets the first line of the famous poem *They Came For Us* was "First, they came for the Communists...". They forget the first victims of the Holocaust were Communists (many were also Jewish).

###### Discussion Questions:

- Why was the KPD's archival material left unpublished?
    - Who benefits from this?
    - How does it benefit them?
- Why was the KPD resistance to Nazism lumped together with social democracy and liberal groups like Christians?
    - Who benefits from this?
    - How does it benefit them?
- Why are Communists left out of holocaust narratives?
    - Who benefits from this?
    - How does it benefit them?
- Why would liberal historians want to portray the imagined labor aristocratic and petit bourgeois resistance to Hitler as effective?

##### The United Front

###### Contemporary relevance:

 - Trump is undoubtedly a fascist and is in office.
 - Some would say that we should be aligning ourselves with liberals to combat him.
 - Much like the author says there's a liberal antifascism and a militant antifascism today
 
###### Discussion questions:

 - Why is making the distinction between Militant and Liberal Fascism important to us?
 - Why does the author distinguish between the common Marxist definition of fascism and Dimitriv’s Formulation?
 - How can fascism be both anti-bourgeois and anti-capitalist?
 - Why would social democrats feel comfortable ceding all governmental authority over to Hitler rather than Backing the KPD?
 - Why would the social-democrat unions be so quick to side with Hitler instead of their constituents if unions don't operate for the ruling class?


##### Liberal Reactions to Fascism

###### Contemporary relevance:

- Trump is running the US into the ground
- He's upsetting long-held informal norms and traditions of government
- Liberals, much like the SPD, are eagerly collaborating against radical organizers.

###### Discussion questions:
 
- Were the SPD correct in their assessment of the nazi's ability to withstand the “test of Power”?
- Do we see any modern parallels with the social democrats of our era?
    - Who are the social democrats of our era?
- Would we say that liberalism is even separate from far-right fascism if both play into one another ultimately maintaining the capitalist system?
- Why do liberals and conservatives often get caught pushing each other's policies in such an anti-Communist manner?

##### The Nature of Fascism:

###### Contemporary Relevance:

- There's a lot of confusion about fascism
- Many people think it's aesthetic but it's more than just that
- Some communists argue that we don't have fascism unless it's white men in Hugo Boss suits goose stepping in a military parade
- Fascism evolves to meet the material and superstructural aspects of the society it arises from. No two fascisms are exactly alike
- Some say that fascism will not be able to govern effectively, that the bourgeoisie will keep institutional checks on them. This is patentely faslse

###### Discussion Questions:

1. How does settler colonialism relate to fascism?
2. How is the concept of a labor aristocracy related to fascism?
3. How does race play into fascism?
4. Were the KPD correct in their assessment of the Nazis being unable to withstand the test of power?
5. Why does the author distinguish between the common Marxist definition of fascism and Dimitriv’s Formulation?
    1. In what ways are they different?
    2. Which do you think is more accurate?
6. How can fascism seemingly be both anti-bourgeois and anti-capitalist?
7. Why would the SS take prisoners from the SA if they were natural allies?
8. What might the concentration camps of American fascism look like?
9. Why would blocking the 29.8 station be a high priority for the Nazis to block as much as they could?

## Appendices

### A. Quick Reference

#### COMINTERN

Communist International. A Soviet-led international governing body of the worlds communist parties. Often referred to as the **Third International** which is what's relevant to the book at hand. Consider it kind of like a non-bourgeois United Nations for international communist parties. The USSR exercised great influence over the course of foreign communist parties through the COMINTERN.

#### SPD

Social Democratic Party of Germany (_Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands_). They are most similar in American terms to the Democratic Socialists of America. The SPD stood in contrast to the KPD. The SPD focused on a revisionist, electoral path to power. They became more concerned with their power and privilege, than they did with revolution. So eventually they began to collaborate openly with the Nazis, and eventually were responsible for the murder of the famous revolutionaries Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. Their leader Friedrich Ebert was the first president of Weimar Germany.

#### KPD

Communist Party of Germany[^1]. They were an anti-revisionist party who joined in the Spartacist Uprising of 1919. They were part of the COMINTERN. Their theory was that the SPD were their rivals with whom they held an antagonistic contradiction. They labeled the SPD as "social fascists" because of their opportunism and desire to collaborate with the Nazi state.

#### Labor Aristocracy

A section of the working class that is found within settler and imperialist countries. A labor aristocrat is a worker whose consciousness aligns with reaction and the bourgeoisie. The reason for this is that the benefits they gain from sharing in the spoils of fascist and imperialist exploitation is greater than the exploitation they face from their ruling class. Labor aristocracy is equally a phenomenon of
