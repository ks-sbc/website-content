*Rural peasants from the Hunan Province took matters into their own hands. What were their methods? How did they manage to claim power?*

The essay may be read [here](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_2.htm). 

# Why are we reading this?

This might seem confusing. We are in Kansas and not in the Hunan Province of China. There is no peasantry in Kansas. This is a century old. So why bother reading it?

The reason we read this is because if we want to learn about how to do a proper social investigation, we need to look back to examples of how other Communists who had successful revolutions did their own social investigations. What kind of things were they looking at? What sort of questions did they ask? How did they go about gathering information? Where did they start? While we can't just blindly copy-and-paste everything that Mao did verbatim (that would be book worship), we can absolutely use his example as an inspiration and a starting point.

On a more theoretical level, our modern Communist and "leftist" movement suffers from many of the same issues plaguing the Chinese communists at the time this document was written. You can read more about that in [[#Context]] but, as the saying goes "There is truly nothing new under the sun." The Chinese had some confusion about who the **revolutionary subject** was. In other words, there were vigorous debates in the CPC about who exactly should Communists be targeting for propaganda and agitation. Who should we be spending our time organizing *as a class*[^1]?

# Context

One of the classic debates among Communist groups is ***who is the revolutionary subject?*** The Chinese were no exception to being riddled by this issue. A two-line struggle emerged around it with [[glossary#Duxiu, Chen|Chen Duxiu]] and [[glossary#Zedong, Mao|Mao Zedong]] representing the two lines.

Duxiu and the right-deviationists took a very mechanical and book-worshiping approach to Marxist theory. They argued that because Marx wrote in the 1800's that the proletariat is the revolutionary class, therefore the communists should focus on organizing the proletariat. Mao, representing the opposing line, correctly argued that the unique conditions of China meant that the peasantry as a class could be mobilized for a revolution[^2].

How do we ultimately know for certain that it was Mao who was correct? How do we know that it wasn't Chen Duxiu who was falsely slandered and castigated? We know simply because ***Mao's theory of revolution proved correct in practice because it succeeded.*** This is how we know the truth of a revolutionary theory. If a revolutionary theory is correct, then by definition that theory will produce revolutionary results. This is how Communists know their theories to be correct and corresponding to reality.

## Correct Ideas: Where Do They Come From?

How did Mao discover this correct information? While part of it certainly came from reading books,  it also came from social practice! Specifically, the practice of investigating one's situation which we call Social Investigations and Class Analysis (SICA). In any contemporary historical situation, the book that describes our condition in perfect detail simply has not been written. In fact, it is impossible to write such a book because any book that is written prior-to, will not contain all the details of contemporary society.

This isn't to say we shouldn't be reading theory or studying history. There are always lessons to be learned from our Communist elders who preceded us and were kind enough to record their thoughts. But, it's also true that the situation of Mao Zedong, for example, varies greatly from the situation of Kansas in 2025. To name just one glaring difference, in Kansas there is no peasantry. But does this mean that Mao suddenly becomes worthless simply because we don't have peasants? Absolutely not!

Contrast this to the approach of Chen Duxiu and the right-deviationists. They did no social investigations of their own. They didn't bother to venture out to the countryside and see the facts for themselves. They argued that because Karl Marx, a dead European man who never once visited China, said the proletariat alone is revolutionary that it must be true. Ironically, it was Duxiu's clique who adopted the backwards and traditional mentalities they accused the peasants of claiming.

So to summarize: this essay was written in the context of a two-line struggle between the right-deviationaist faction of Chen Duxiu, and the correct faction of Mao Zedong. Duxiu's clique argued that because Marx wrote in a book that the proletariat is the revolutionary subject, therefore only they can be revolutionary and that the peasants were reactionary. Mao represented the opposing and correct line, which said that the proletariat should lead a revolutionary alliance with the peasantry as its strongest ally. Mao and the comrades came to this correct conclusion by investigating the facts on the ground.

# Part 1-3

## Efforts Involved in SICA

This is brief so we'll keep it brief. One observation though: Mao talks about how he spetn 32 days conducting this SICA. That is 32 days of one man doing a full-time job. Let's suppose that since it's Mao, he's an extra hard worker and spends 12 hours a day actively devoted to social investigations. That would translate into **384 labor-hours** that went into this investigation along. That's not factoring in the time it took to write and edit this document. Let's round it up to 400 hours just to be certain.

It took 1 man 400 working hours and a month of actual time to perform this investigation. In an average American work week, there are 40 hours of labor per week. If this were one person's full-time job, they would need 10 weeks to conduct a thorough social investigation working at it as if it were a full-time job. But, we cannot do that. None of us are professional communists who get paid to do communism. We have to do this outside of our jobs, in our spare time.

I won't belabor the numbers point anymore, other than to point out that ***a proper social investigation takes times and effort***. IT's not something you do in one or two days and then call it good to go. Ideally, it should constantly be refined and reworked.

## Three Options

> **Every revolutionary party and every revolutionary comrade will be put to the test, to be accepted or rejected as they decide. There are three alternatives. To march at their head and lead them? To trail behind them, gesticulating and criticizing? Or to stand in their way and oppose them? Every Chinese is free to choose, but events will force you to make the choice quickly.**

When it comes to mass movements in general, we're given three realistic choices: lead, follow, or obstruct. There is no alternative here. THink about this the next time someone tells you it's "not your place" to step up, or that it's wrong or 'hierarchical' to take a leadership role.

## All Power to the Peasants.

What did these associations of peasants do? Did they merely bargain with the landlord to let them keep more crops? Did they kindly ask the local police to please stop harassing them? No! They became the authorities. They asserted themselves. They took on a dominant role in society. They were organic movements made up of the peasants, led by the peasants, and working for the interests of the peasantry as a class.

Compare this with your typical NGO non-profit in the States.

## Questions:

Questions:
1. When we look at the revolutionary subject, who gets portrayed as "the riffaff"? What ways do you see this manifest itself in contemporary culture?

# Part 8: Vanguards of the Revolution

The view of the peasants association as Vanguards of the Revolution emerges in opposition to the view that the Peasant Associations are the "Riffraff of the Movement." But how did this fall along class lines in China? This is one of the most important sections as it begins the class analysis part of SICA.

Mao talks about the peasants having three different strata: the rich peasantry, the middle peasantry, and the poor peasantry. The rich peasants were apprehensive and generally refused to join unless forced to do so. They didn't see a point in it. The middle peasants were skeptical, but could be persuaded. However, generally they were unenthsuiastic participants and remained paper members. Their opinions and attitudes toward the peasant association are vaccillating. That is to say, they waver and are unsteady.

Finally, there are the poor peasants who form the social basis of the peasant associations. They are the most vigorous and enthusiatic supporters of the peasant association. They take up roles in its leadership.

> Leadership by the poor peasants is absolutely necessary. Without the poor peasants there would be no revolution. To deny their role is to deny the revolution. To attack them is to attack the revolution. They have never been wrong on the general direction of the revolution. They have discredited the local tyrants and evil gentry. They have beaten down the local tyrants and evil gentry, big and small, and kept them underfoot. Many of their deeds in the period of revolutionary action, which were labeled as "going too far", were in fact the very things the revolution required

QUESTIONS:
1. How does Mao link the revolutionary potential of the peasants as a class with their participation in peasant associations?
2. Compare the class outlooks of the three peasant strata with our own class situation today. How might we classify various social classes and groups revolutionary potential in our own situation, similar to what Mao did?
	1. Goes along with revolution, but doesn't actually care and wants them off their backs
		1. Petit Bourgeois - middle management, bureaucrats, professionals
			1. revolutions often started by professionals b/c they have more free time and money, higher level of education, desire to help & ego trip, travel, exposes to injustices
			2. PBs can do the reading, looking to use resources to actually help vs being performative to look good
			3. Capitalism suffers from, everybody is stepping over
	2. They'll participate, but in a passive way
	3. Active and enthsuastic supporters
3. How do we go about "combatting the counter-revolutionary talk of a 'movement of riffraff' and a 'movement of lazy peasants' in our own context?"
4. Mao talks about how the poor peasants are not all roses and sunshine. He speaks of some bad habits of the class, including things like a taste for gambling and an inclination towards banditry. What would you say are the equivalent shortcomings of our own modern lower classes?
5. Mao emphasiszes how even though such shortcomings are real, we must be patient in our education. What might that look like in our own situation?

[^1]: To emphasize, we are discussing about this ***as a class***. As individuals, people can go any which way. But when discussing social classes in the abstract, those classes have certain characteristics as a result of their material position and relationships, that give rise to certain attitudes, outlooks, behaviors, psycholgies, etc. As Communists therefore, while we recognize anyone can be radicalized, we focus our efforts and go to the people whose class position renders them most susceptible to our message. That's not to say others can't participate, but rather that **we let them come to us. We don't need to go to them**.

[^2]: It's very important to note that the peasantry, while it was the largest faction of the alliance for Chinese New Democracy, was not the leading faction. The revolutionary New Democratic movement in China was, of course, led by the proletariat despite the proletariat being small in numbers. Mao correctly understood this. However, Duxiu and his clique did not argue merely for this. They wanted to go too far in the right-wing direction and argue that the peasantry should be excluded entirely, due to backward cultural values and beliefs among other things.

[^3]: By Gentry we mean something like an aristocratic nobility and a social elite.

[^4]: By Tyrants we mean people such as the police, highway bandits, corrupt government officials, tax collectors, etc.
