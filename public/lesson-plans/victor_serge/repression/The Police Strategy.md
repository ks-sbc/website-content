# The Overall Goal

Recall Serge's quote from the Okrahna secret police manual, which reads "***The Political Police must prepare to destroy the revolutionary centres at the moment their activity is greatest and not allow their work to be diverted by dwelling on secondary undertakings.***" We've discussed a bit of what this means, but we will now go into greater detail about how exactly they go about executing this strategy.

# The Network Diagram

*IMAGE DESCRIPTION: A famous cutscene-turned-meme from the TV show "It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia". In this picture, the character Charlie Day looks manic and strung out, with his bug-eyes wide open. He is smoking a cigarette and pointing to a wall of disorganized documents with red strings connecting them.*

Most people know of the Pepe Silvia meme. While that is a meme from a television show, it's an actual practice of police departments -- although their boards are much neater, organized, and nowadays digital. Serge documents this in Chapter 1, Section XII *Summarising Reports: the diagram method*. Although Serge is describing a seemingly archaic methodology which has been replaced by databases and GUIs, the overall spirit of this police work remains the same. An in-depth technological deep-dive into how the diagram method uses modern computing is outside the scope of our lesson here, but for those curious you can learn more about it [here](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/occasional_papers/2009/RAND_OP258.pdf), [here](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/trecms/pdf/AD1069683.pdf) and [here](https://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/22591/frontmatter/9781107022591_frontmatter.pdf).

Serge writes that the police take interest in four specific kinds of intelligence:

1. Information from external surveillance (tailing), the results of which are summed up in analytical diagrams, to shed light on the enemyâ€™s activities and movements, habits, acquaintanceships, circle, etc.
2. Information from the secret service or from informers on his ideas, intentions, work, clandestine activity.
3. The information which can be gleaned from a very careful reading of the revolutionary press and publications.
4. Finally, information from his correspondence, or the correspondence of other persons with him, completes the whole.

We must make a discussion about technology, even if this isn't about tech. Social Media is a brand new thing that exists which did not in the time period Serge lived in. Social Media is a police officers dream come true. They don't even need to send an informant half the time, because people will just tell them about their whole lives on social media! Even something as innocuous as posting a photo of you and some friends at a party can be dangerous nowadays -- not only have you given away your own face, but you've also given away the faces of some of your close accomplices and friends. And you do all of this work for free (in fact someone else profits off it) without them having to bother with a warrant, or interrogate anyone.

# Forensics

The police want to collect not only information about your thoughts and associations, but also your appearance. Should you ever become a wanted person, they will want to identify you. So therefore, distinct features are of vital importance. Birth marks, tattoos, scars, surgical modifications, all of these are of interest to the cops. Furthermore, the development of AI in recent years has only accelerated and exacerbated this trend. Now, the cops don't even need to monitor things manually. A computer program will scrape through billions of photographs to find your one, and it only takes an officer to validate the AI match. Some of the services such as Clearwater are very accurate.

Forensics can be applied to things which aren't your appearance as well. They have AIs that can analyze the tone and patterns of your writing habits, and give estimates of the likelihood that the author of a communique is a particular revolutionary.

# The Final Blow

After the police have gathered your network and learned of your associations, they wait until the opportune time to strike. They know who the leaders are. They know relations abut you that even you yourself didn't know existed. They know exactly who to target. And should your group ever become a sufficient threat, they will arrest or raid or just straight execute the leadership. The police will always, however, lave behind one or two people that they can follow as they inevitably seed and begin a new organization.
