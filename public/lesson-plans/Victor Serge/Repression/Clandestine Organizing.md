> Be on your guard against conspiracy mania, against posing, adopting airs of mystery, dramatising simple events, or “conspiratorial” attitudes. The greatest virtue in a revolutionary is simplicity, and scorn for all poses ... including “revolutionary” and especially conspiratorial poses.

- What is a pose?
	- Aesthetic pretenses that someone might associate with being a revolutionary that is devoid of the substance of being connected t the masses, being humble, create unity, heighten consciousness.
	- **Inability to set aside your ego and come off as looking revolutionary vs being revolutionary**
	- Example: Imitating the uniforms and guns etc of the BPP for self defense completely devoide of the overall context.
	- Ppl engage as if they were Lenin and they're polemecising against Trotsky. Fail to recognize the context of Lenin's polemics.
		- First try to engage in a comradely way
		- Polemicism accumulates over time at the recognition of an irreconcilable contradiction that has been attempted to be resolved vs failed
	- Declaring yourself into being a thing vs proving yourself and the correctness of your ideas.
- What is a "conspiratorial attitude"?
	- Fedjacketing and copjacketing
		- Levying accusations that are false and slanderous
		- Putting too much energy into direction of inculcating yourself from infiltration in a way that isn't focused on principle and organizaing
		- ***Fastest way in the world to kill group solidarity***
	- Parapolitics
		- Demoralizing, reifies state

# The Problem of Illegality
> Fetishism of legality was and still is one of the characteristic features of the class-collaboration tendency of socialism. It involves a belief in the possibility of transforming the capitalist order without entering into conflict with its privileged elements. But rather than indicating a naivety quite incompatible with the mentality of politicians, it is a sign of the corruption of the leaders. Entrenched in a society they pretend to be fighting, they recommend respecting the rules of the game. The working class can only respect bourgeois legality if it ignores the real role of the state and the deceptive nature of democracy; in short, the first principles of the class struggle.

Serge writes that "... **The only way the worker can view legality is as a fact, whose different facets he should know about, with its different applications, traps and pitfalls (and also advantages, which should be made use of at certain points) but which should be nothing but a purely material obstacle to his class.**"

What Serge writes to this very day rings quite true! All too often, under the guise of being "reasonable" or of "avoiding adventurism" the socialist movement is afraid to even broach discussions of illegal actions. There is an element of the truth here: we should absolutely not be planning specific actions out in the open or encouraging reckless sorts of behaviors. It's good to avoid arrest.

But, we must understand that bourgeois law is written not for our own benefit but for the benefit of the ruling class. Why should we feel bound to it?

This right-deviationist approach of fetishizing legality is often met with its dialectical opposite: the fetishization of criminal activity and illegality. Serge writes, "... sometimes among good revolutionaries there emerges the diametrical opposite of fetishising legality – due to a kind of tendency to make the least political effort (*it is easier to conspire than to lead mass action*) they have a certain disdain for legal action."

So what is the ideal balance? We cannot make a fetish out of Illegality, but going to the polar opposite of adventurism is also bad. What is to be done?

Serge recommends a kind of synergy between illegal action and legal organizing. Since there isn't an essential moral quality to either, the working class movement needs to view them merely as two approaches to the same goal, devoid of excessive sentimentality or moral grandstanding. He specifically recommends that Communist movements take great care to avoid "being taken unawares."

What is meant by this? Quite simply it means ***taking full advantage of legal avenues of mass organizing while they exist, and at the same time making preparations under the assumption that tomorrow your org will suddenly become illegal.*** He cites the example of the German Communist Party (KPD):

> At the end of 1923, after the revolutionary events of October and the Hamburg insurrection, the German CP was dissolved by General von Seeckt. Prepared over a long period, and with flexible, illegal organisations, it was nonetheless able to continue its normal existence. The government soon had to reconsider a measure of such evident inanity. The German CP came out of illegality with its forces hardly impaired, to get over three and a half million votes in the 1924 elections.

- Fetishization of legality (right-deviation) is currently the bigger problem than fetishization of illegality (left-deviation).
	- Shortcomings of illegality is something that is commonly understood
	- If we as a movement can demystify state power and control that concretely shows what state power truly is, that is significant in combatting the right deviation
	- Adventurism is a reaction to opportunism, it's not the principal error
	- Conditions that we're in are increasingly radicalizing people, the right deviationist tendencies are alienating to those who desire escalating rhetoric and tactics

# Private Police
Police are a heavily militarized institution, and although they are extremely anti democratic they still rely upon a veneer of legitimacy to operate. This is why we're allowed things such as the Riley County Law Board.

Yet as an institution devoted to maintaining the social order, the police must none the less be willing to break the law themselves. So how do they balance this line between maintaining the illusion of legitimacy, with doing what needs to be done? They outsource their dirty work to private parties.

In the book, Serge cited the example of Italy with the Mafia and the Blackshirts; Germany with the Freikorps; and the United States with the Pinkerton detective agency. Note that these organizations aren't all strictly police. Some of them are criminal associations like the Mafia, others are private militia like the Freikorps. The point isn't the specific form that these private actors take, but rather their political alignment. The important lesson here is that ***these private agencies collaborate with the police, and give them a degree of plausible deniability. In exchange, they are allowed to operate freely without interference of the cops.*** So a Mafioso who has orders from the cops to whack a communist labor organizer would have the cops turn a blind eye to his other activities like drug dealing, extortions, or gambling. This is the nature of the bargain at play here.

# Advice to Revolutionaries
Serge gives some advice on how to navigate the contours of Illegality in an organizing context. Here are the summaries of important points:
- Being a revolutionary isn't a hobby, nor a part time job, nor a charade. It's a full time profession with life and death consequences.
- Bad reasons to become a revolutionary include trying to cultivate an aura of mystery and "being a bad ass"; taking pleasure in having the most extreme or advanced ideas; thrill seeking and enjoyment of danger; or just trying to make a new group of friends.
- The profession of revolutionary activity is like any other profession. It involves a large investment of time, careful study, the development of refined habits, a serious world view, and the mastery of various techniques, protocols, and habits. It requires above all else discipline and consistency.
- be very careful with what you wrote. Some things are better forgotten than to risk falling into the hands of the enemy.
- ***Keep certain information on a strict need to know basis. Limit who you tell sensitive information to.*** it can often feel cool and important to be in the loop. But, a serious and dedicated revoltionary knows that what he doesn't need to know about, he doesn't know about. If a comrade seems to give a vague answer, or seems hesitant to reply, understand that it's nothing personal and just business.
- the revolutionary does not let their ego guide them. They always learn to stay humble.
- ***Should you ever find yourself being questioned by the cops, shut the fuck up!!!!***
	- this one is ***really*** important!
	- anything you say CAN and WILL be used against you
	- don't lie to the police, that can be dangerous. But not telling the whole truth, or abstaining from talking at all, isn't the same as lying.
	- cops are professional liars. They are experts of manipulation. From the moment of your first interaction, and often before then, they have already psychologically profiled you. They know precisely what to say,.to get you to talk. They may pretend to be friendly, only to snap at a random time and suddenly be screaming at you. Do not be received or intimidated by this. ***The cops are liars and not to be trusted.***
	- you are not more clever than a policeman. On an individual level you probably are, but they are an occupying army! They have vast sums of resources at their disposal. Don't try to think you'll pull a fast one on them.
