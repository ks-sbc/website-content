# Chapter 4: On the Red Terror
Tankie. Authoritarian. Totalitarian. Dictatorship. Surely you've heard all these words and more used to describe actually existing Socialist states and movements. In our final lesson, to close out the book, we spent most of it talking about the White Terror: reactionary repression used to protect and defend the bourgeois social order. But, when revoltions succeed, what about the inversion of White Terror? The Cheka, the Red Guards, the KGB, the Stasi; in other words, what about communist repression of internal and external enemies to revolution? That is what this final chapter seeks to discuss.

# On Authoritarianism
Surely you've heard it repeated a thousand times. Communism is repressive, Communists hate freedom, Communism is a dictatorship, Communism is just a powerful elite! The list of such ridiculous claims goes on and on, but they can all be summarized by the phrase "Tankie".

While these claims are nonsense, we'd be doing nobody any favors to lie. So, ***it is quite true that in Marxist revoltions, that the revolutionaries upon seizing power did resort to many brutal and ruthless methods.*** So doesn't that make them just as bad as the people they overthrew?

This is a tempting conclusion to come to. For many people, including among the left such as anarchists, this criticism holds a lot of weight. However, a careful consideration of the facts reveals that Red Terror (the repression of revolutionary movements) and white terror (the repression used by the ruling class) is a false illusion. Both are repressive, but on whose behalf do they repress? And who is being repressed? These are where the fundamental differences lie.

# The Machine Gun? Or The Typewriter?
> Some of them wax lyrical in disapproval of all violence and all dictatorship. To put an end to oppression, poverty, prostitution and war, they trust only in the intervention – above all the literary intervention – of the Mind. In fact enjoying considerable comfort in society as it is, they haughtily place themselves “above the social melée”. What they especially prefer to the machine-gun is the typewriter.
>
> Others, without repudiating violence, formally repudiate dictatorship. The revolution appears to tern to be a miraculous liberation. They dream of a human race made instantly peaceful and good by the removal of its bonds. They dream, in defiance of history, truth, common sense and their own experience, of a total revolution, doubtless not only idyllic, but short, decisive and definitive, leading to a radiant morrow. ... No period of transition; no dictatorship of the proletariat (“Down with all dictatorship!”); no repression after the workers’ victory; no revolutionary tribunals, no Cheka! – above all, ye gods, no Cheka! – no more prisons ... A smooth entry into the free city of communism, the arrival straight after the tempest at the Blessed Isles. What these revolutionaries – our libertarian brothers – prefer to the machine-gun is garlands of roses, red roses.
> 
> A third lot, finally, profess that for the moment the monopoly of the use of the machine gun should be left to the possessing classes, and that one should try to lead them on gently, by persuasion, to give them up ... Meanwhile, these reformers take infinite pains to get ultra- rapid firing regulated by international conference ... They appear to be divided into two categories: those who genuinely prefer negotiation to the machine-gun; and those who, because they are practical and free from illusions, honestly prefer the use of asphyxiating gases.

We should first establish the following universal law of political power: ***no established state authority in the history of states will ever allow a revolution. They will protect themselves against a revolution at all costs.*** After the Russian revolution of 1917, there were many bad actors who were seeking to undo the popular gains of the people: the Black Hundreds, the White Army, the US military, the German empire, etc. therefore we have to understand that this newly found proletarian state wanted to secure its gains so that the comrades who died for the revolution would not have died for nothing.

Serge talks of institutions. He writes, "An institution, on the contrary, does change along with the men and still more, infinitely more, ***the classes which make use of it.***" Perhaps you've heard the phrase *dictatorship of the proletariat*. This reflects the accurate nature of the Soviet state: an organ of political power which wielded its new found authority on behalf of the proletariat. Compare this to the Tsarist empire, or to our own government. These governments can be said to be a *dictatorship of the bourgeoisie*. Herein lies one essential difference between a communist state and a liberal democracy. In proletarian democracy, it is the workers and peasants who control political power. In liberalism, it is the bourgeoisie who are the ones controlling power.

Let's do a small exercise to emphasize this point:

Here's a picture of American police officers.

What are some differences you notice between the two?

# Race and the American bourgeois dictatorship

Since we're all USians in this lesson, one thing that separates our own policing situation from post revolutionary Russia is the historical legacy of slavery. Institutions inherit a rich historical legacy, and so it's worth investigating that when talking about the nature of political repression and it's character.

It is historical fact that the United States was founded on slavery of African people. In fact, if we look at the quintessential symbol of law enforcement in the US -- the star shaped badge -- it's historical legacy comes from that of the slave patrols. Although chattel slavery is illegal[^1] the police still have a brutal legacy of racism to this day. Did this anti-Black racism fall from the sky? Did it mysteriously appear out of nowhere? No! It follows from a centuries long legacy with its roots in the antebellum slave patrols. This historical character gives Amerikan cops their distinctly racist character.

Serge eloquently summarizes this point when he writes:

> We do not deny that terror is terrible. Threatened with death, the proletarian revolution resorted to it in Russia for three years, from 1918 to 1921. It is too readily forgotten that apart from the revolutions necessary to give it birth, bourgeois society took centuries of terror to emerge and grow. Big capitalist property took shape over the centuries through the implacable eviction of the tillers of the soil; manufacturing and then industrial capital were accumulated by the implacable exploitation, aided by bloody legislation, of the dispossessed peasantry, reduced as they were to beggary.

Compare this to the historical legacy of policing in the USSR. Unlike the US slave patrols evolving into cops, in the Soviet Union there was no historical precedent. Recall that the Okrahna were the mortal enemies of the Bolsheviks. Any comparison of the Cheka[^2] to the Okrahna are therefore nonsense; the two institutions had nothing in common besides the most superficial similarities, such as they both used handcuffs. The Cheka was an entirely new thing! This is because they were the product of the historically unprecedented Russian Revolution.

# Dog Eat Dog World
Our enemies are ruthless and will not stop at any lengths to stop a revoltionary threat. Just look at how our own FBI murdered the Revolutionary Fred Hampton: In cold blood, asleep in bed, next to his pregnant wife. They killed him in a firestorm of machine gun bullets. Next to a pregnant woman!

Other revolutions which wavered and vacillated on their level of ruthlessness ended up paying the ultimate price of failure. Serge cites the Paris Commune and the Finnish Revolution as two principal examples.

Revolutionary movements are a gruesome affair. They require human being to do inhuman deeds sometimes. The difference between a communist and a fascist, however, is that communists do these things out of necessity. Whereas fascists do them for the sake of pleasure and sadistic cruelty.

# Excesses 
Everyone loves to criticize the Bolsheviks for some cruelty or another. Disney made an entire movie about it, Anastasia. In the Revolution, it is true that the Bolsheviks slaughtered the royal family of Tsar Nicholas, to include the children. From a liberal perspective, this may have seemed excessive.

But put yourself in the shoes of one of these revolutionaries for a minute. The Bolsheviks were dealing with a hereditary monarchy which has a fanatical and loyal following of die-hards. Should they let an heir to the Tsar live, and give the Black Hundreds a human idol around which they can rally? Remember that the peasantry was still quite religious, and they formed the majority of the Russian revolution. What's worst: a restoration of reactionary terror that would ultimately harm everyone and make all those deaths in vein? Or to murder the royal family? The Bolsheviks were the first ones to try it out.

Not every revolution has followed this path. In China, it was the Communists who decided to spare the life of Puyi, the former Qing Dynasty emperor. They genuinely re-educated him, and Putin eventually came around to the ideas of communism. He eventually was released from incarceration and lived a fulfilling life as an everyday worker.

Serge writes about excesses:
> In every social battle, a certain percentage of excesses, abuses and errors cannot be avoided. The duty of the party and of all revolutionaries is to work to limit these. The scale of these errors only really depends on the following factors:
>
> 1. The balance of forces at the time and the bitterness of the struggle;
> 2. The level of organisation of the action; the effectiveness of control over the action exercised by the party of the proletariat.
> 3. The level of culture of the proletarian and peasant masses.

[^1]: we must comment here that slavery itself is not illegal. The thirteenth amendment of the US Constitution explicitly allows for slavery as punishment for a crime. But this modern form of prison slavery, though it bears many similarities in terms of the races of prison slaves, is not the same as chattel slavery.
