# The Overall Goal

Recall Serge's quote from the Okrahna secret police manual, which reads "***The Political Police must prepare to destroy the revolutionary centres at the moment their activity is greatest and not allow their work to be diverted by dwelling on secondary undertakings.***" We've discussed a bit of what this means, but we will now go into greater detail about how exactly they go about executing this strategy.

# The Network Diagram

*IMAGE DESCRIPTION: A famous cutscene-turned-meme from the TV show "It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia". In this picture, the character Charlie Day looks manic and strung out, with his bug-eyes wide open. He is smoking a cigarette and pointing to a wall of disorganized documents with red strings connecting them.*

Most people know of the Pepe Silvia meme. While that is a meme from a television show, it's an actual practice of police departments -- although their boards are much neater, organized, and nowadays digital. Serge documents this in Chapter 1, Section XII *Summarising Reports: the diagram method*. Although Serge is describing a seemingly archaic methodology which has been replaced by databases and GUIs, the overall spirit of this police work remains the same. An in-depth technological deep-dive into how the diagram method uses modern computing is outside the scope of our lesson here, but for those curious you can learn more about it [here](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/occasional_papers/2009/RAND_OP258.pdf), [here](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/trecms/pdf/AD1069683.pdf) and [here](https://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/22591/frontmatter/9781107022591_frontmatter.pdf).

Serge writes that the police take interest in four specific kinds of intelligence:

1. Information from external surveillance (tailing), the results of which are summed up in analytical diagrams, to shed light on the enemyâ€™s activities and movements, habits, acquaintanceships, circle, etc.
2. Information from the secret service or from informers on his ideas, intentions, work, clandestine activity.
3. The information which can be gleaned from a very careful reading of the revolutionary press and publications.
4. Finally, information from his correspondence, or the correspondence of other persons with him, completes the whole.

TODO:
- PimEyes removal
- Burner phones

We must make a discussion about technology, even if this isn't about tech. Social Media is a brand new thing that exists which did not in the time period Serge lived in. Social Media is a police officers dream come true. They don't even need to send an informant half the time, because people will just tell them about their whole lives on social media! Even something as innocuous as posting a photo of you and some friends at a party can be dangerous nowadays -- not only have you given away your own face, but you've also given away the faces of some of your close accomplices and friends. And you do all of this work for free (in fact someone else profits off it) without them having to bother with a warrant, or interrogate anyone.

# Forensics

The police want to collect not only information about your thoughts and associations, but also your appearance. Should you ever become a wanted person, they will want to identify you. So therefore, distinct features are of vital importance. Birth marks, tattoos, scars, surgical modifications, all of these are of interest to the cops. Furthermore, the development of AI in recent years has only accelerated and exacerbated this trend. Now, the cops don't even need to monitor things manually. A computer program will scrape through billions of photographs to find your one, and it only takes an officer to validate the AI match. Some of the services such as Clearwater are very accurate.

Forensics can be applied to things which aren't your appearance as well. They have AIs that can analyze the tone and patterns of your writing habits, and give estimates of the likelihood that the author of a communique is a particular revolutionary.

# The Final Blow

After the police have gathered your network and learned of your associations, they wait until the opportune time to strike. They know who the leaders are. They know relations abut you that even you yourself didn't know existed. They know exactly who to target. And should your group ever become a sufficient threat, they will arrest or raid or just straight execute the leadership. The police will always, however, lave behind one or two people that they can follow as they inevitably seed and begin a new organization.

- Individualism and Organizing: you want to feel special, unique, be seen and perceived as the leader. You don't put as much energy and emphasis on the redundancy and capacity to satisfy your ego.
	- Right deviationism and opportunism creates careers that people buy into

# Questions

1. After reading this section, think about social media.
	1. Did it change your assessment of it?
		1. Like a magnet for cops
		2. Overcorrection of not using social media at all.
			1. Exacerbated some of the worst tendencies of the culture of communication.
				1. Constant dunks vs comradely discourse
				2. Discourages finding unity
				3. **Cyberspace is a terrain of struggle**
				4. The platforms we have to struggle on are completely controlled by the bourgeoisie
				5. Geared in an unhealthy fashion
				6. Contradiction: Its a plane of struggle and we have to be there, but the platforms themselves are also unhealthy
			2. We have to use every means available to us and that includes social media
				1. "If you take the bus one day, there's less carbon molecules"
				2. No ethical consumption isn't always true
			3. ***Translate online contacts into IRL contacts***.
				1. Meeting up offline
				2. Representing an org forces you to think outside of your own narrow interests
				3. Taking the comms out of the platform
			4. Can we develop platforms that expand these limitations?
				1. It would be good but its a shit ton of effort
				2. By the nature of social media, they tend towards monopoly. Either have a platform that is broad and lots of ppl, or niche and very few people. Our platforms would necessarily be niche
				3. Encrypted discord (matrix)
			5. 
	2. How does social media help the cops?
	3. What kind of information does social media give the police?
	4. **social media is a crucial aspect of organizing. But it also has many drawbacks. What do folks think should be done to strike a balance between legitimate security threats vs reaching the masses?**
	5. Good for beginning of class consciousness, but how to get people to step out of that into the real world.
		1. The algorithms isolate you into little corners of an echo chamber
		2. 
2. Think about the common security advice you've received and/or given in Activist circles. How does this compare to what Serge says?
	1. Typical organizing advice
		1. Examples of typical advice:
			1. Don't bring your phone
			2. Hyperfocus on the specific technology
			3. Don't use FaceID
		2. Security Theater. Think of the TSA. A bunch of tiny things go into the rules of security, but 9/11 was with box cutters.
			1. Build consent for the system
			2. Doesn't account for organized effort
			3. ***Organize ourselves so our actions cannot be co-opted.***
			4. ***Organize so that the only way a bad actor can progress in your org is by advancing the organization itself***.
		3. **All of these techniques are hyper-focused on tactical questions devoid of strategy**.
		4. An individual cannot overcome an enemy that is capable of overpowering you.
			1. If there's more than one person, you're fucked
	2. How does it differ from Sergei
		1. Examples:
			1. ***Organize ourselves so our actions cannot be co-opted.***
			2. ***Organize so that the only way a bad actor can progress in your org is by advancing the organization itself***.
			3.  
		2. ***Good Politics Is It's Own Form Of Security***
3. Serge writes a lot about letters, but organizers today mostly use digital means of communication.
	1. What lessons can we extract from Serge's writing that apply to modern communications?
	2. How do our modern communications networks aid the police?
