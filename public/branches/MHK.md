The Manhattan Branch of the KS-SBC is hereby known as the *Flint Hills Marxist Study Group* (FHMSG).

# About

^c944c5

The purpose of the FHMSG is to educate the masses of Manhattan and the greater Flint Hills region (Riley + Geary County) about the science of Marxism as laid out in the [[bylaws|Bylaws of the KS-SBC]]. The intent is for us to take class-conscious working class and sympathetic petit-bourgeois individuals and transform them into proletarian-minded Communists through rigorous study. We aim to accomplish this goal in a manner that is accessible, engaging, entertaining, and community-building.

We will draw our study materials from the [[curriculum|curriculum of the KS-SBC]]. At the end of each session, those in attendance can express which of the topics laid out in the Points of Unity of the Bylaws they are interested in learning more about. Then the Organizers of the FHMSG will suggest a few appropriate readings from the Curriculum, and the group will democratically decide on what next to read. In this fashion, a balance is maintained between **ideological rigor and coherence**, and **giving people a voice to decide** what they want to learn more about.  ^5f8ac7
