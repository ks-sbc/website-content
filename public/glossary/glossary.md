As a service we wish to maintain our own Glossary of Marxist Terminology. We firstly hope this may be an educational tool. Secondly, as a formal organization, we need to be specific about what we mean. Therefore, when we use a phrase we seek to define it!

# A-M

## Agent Provocateur

An [[adventuristic]] individual, usually either a police informant or an undercover cop, who does some kind of illegal crime that results in the police having cover to swoop in and crack down on the event. Although they're usually in the employ of cops, ***anyone can be an agent provocateur***. You don't have to be working for the feds, to be advancing their agenda.

It's also important to note that people sometimes spontaneously have a militant attitude. We don't want to discourage militancy! It's a fine balance between what's authentic sentiment of the masses, versus what's out of place and adventuristic. But usually the indicator is that they wildly are out of touch with the people, the mood of the situation, and the general sentiment.

## Duxiu, Chen

**8 October 1879 –27 May 1942**. Founding member of the Communist Party of China, from the Anhui province of China. He had a history as a revolutionary being involved with the May Fourth Movement of early Republican China, as well as the Xinhai Revolution to overthrow the Qing monarchy. He adhered to the ideology of [[#Trotskyism]].

Duxiu was a right-opportunist within the party. He argued for what Mao Zedong would refer to as "Book Worship". In Duxiu's theory, he argued that because traditional Marxism and the Marxist texts said the proletariat was the revolutionary subject, and that the peasantry was backward and reactionary. This is opposed to Comrade Mao's theory that the peasantry, with the proletariat, form the principal factions of the revolutionary subject.

Duxiu was eventually purged from the party as a result of his refusal to self-criticise and his [[#Right Opportunism|right deviationism]].

## Feudalism

# Landlord

# N-Z

## Peasant

A social class that was the exploited class under [[#Feudalism|feudalism]]. The peasantry's role was to work the land and harvest it at the behest of the ruling-class [[#Landlord|landlords]]. Surplus of peasant labor was appropriated in the form of direct agricultural produce, rather than in the abstract form of wage-labor. The peasantry has a genuine tie to the land, working and living in the same plot that was also worked by their ancestors.

Under capitalism, as the mode of the production shifts away from feudalism and into capitalism, a peasantry can sometimes remain even thought he principal mode of development is capitalism. This is due to the unevenness of economic development under capitalism. We typically see this in countries subjected to colonialism, such as China.

## Revolutionary Subject

The classes or social groups in a society which have the highest amount of revolutionary potential. This is based off their class consciousness, their relations to the means of production, and the specifics of their oppression. To answer the question of "Who is the revolutionary subject?" is a principal task of any Marxist organization. It affects everything, from the basis of theory to how we organize. This is because the revolutionary subject is the answer to the classic revolutionary question "Who are my friends?"

## Right Opportunism

## Trotskyism
