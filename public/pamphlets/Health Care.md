2. First Inside Panel (opens to):
   You're sitting in the emergency room at 2 AM, watching your child struggle to breathe. The TV plays endless ads for medications you can't afford. Their commercials never talk about discounts, but they're all too eager to offer you payment plans with interest and fees. Every politician and business "expert" has a different solution, but they all sound like they live in another galaxy. Meanwhile, your child is gasping, and you're drowning in a sea of contradictions.
   
   As Communists, we recognize this moment for what it is: capitalism turning your loved one's illnesses and your child's disability into shareholder and CEO profits. We understand situations like this are all too common, and represent the darkest hours in a workers life. It feels like society is stacked against you, and that there is no hope for change.

3. This crisis isn't unique to healthcare. Whether it's housing, education, or medicine, we face the same pattern: complexity that serves profit, explanations that hide more than they reveal, and 'solutions' that never solve anything. The ruling class that exploits us wants us to be too demoralized and confused to take action. We, your local Communists, want to equip our community with the tools to clarify the confusion and bolster our morale.
   
   That's why us Communists study how these exploitative systems really work. We don't want to bandage over issues; we believe in digging deep to the root causes. Our group studies of working-class history showed us that understanding any part requires tools to see the whole. These are the same tools that helped people liberate themselves from vampiric capitalists. These are the tools that built world-class hospitals and cutting-edge medicines.
   
4. Around the world, Communist parties have helped workers, poor people, the unemployed and the oppressed understand and transform their conditions. In China, Cuba, and the Soviet Union, workers and peasants built healthcare systems that served the masses, not the ruling class. They were penniless despite being overworked. How did they overcome these grim odds? They won their freedom by coming together, studying systematically, and taking collective action.
   
5. Join us in building this understanding together. We're not experts separated from ordinary people â€“ we're workers, parents, and neighbors just like you. We're Communists because we've learned that real change comes through collective study and organized action. We invite you to join us, and embrace the shining light of Marxism as a sword to pierce through the darkness of lies and oppression.
   
   Meet us every Wednesday at 6:30 PM at the Manhattan Public Library. Together, we'll learn the tools to see through confusion to clarity, whether facing medical bills or any other crisis that capitalism creates.
