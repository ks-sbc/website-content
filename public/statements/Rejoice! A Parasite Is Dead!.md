# CELEBRATE JUSTICE! IT IS RIGHTEOUS TO INSULT THE DEAD!
![[csm_Chinese_Revolution_b3e017054b-2859254462.jpeg]]
*The former CEO of United Healthcare was disposed of by a brave anonymous soul[^1][^2]. A member of the working class like you and I. Perhaps you feel guilty for taking pleasure in this news. **We are here to tell you that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the way you feel!** There is something wrong about a society that expects us to mourn and grieve our oppressors righteous death.*

## THE END OF A CORPORATE PREDATOR
![[20241204_175200.jpg]]

Friends, workers, comrades—let us gather in spirit and in celebration. Today, the world feels just a little lighter. Today, the chains that suffocate us seem to loosen, even if just for a fleeting moment. Today, we rejoice in the removal of one of the architects of our misery.

A parasite, masquerading as a person -- the United Healthcare CEO who grew fat from the pain of others; who lived not by labor, but by feasting upon the sweat and blood of the working class -- has met his timely and righteous end. No sorrow. No remorse. Only the sweet catharsis of knowing the world is less burdened by his presence.

## The Truth They Never Tell You
![[Pyramid_of_Capitalist_System-625850739.jpg]]

This man, whose name hardly matters, was not just a CEO. He was a symbol. A reminder of everything wrong with this system that dares to call itself civilized. While the sick begged for medicine and families were bankrupted by hospital bills, he smiled, signed contracts, and rewarded himself obscene bonuses. He was not a leader; he was a vampire, a leech, and a predator. Every last penny of his wealth was stolen from the lives he helped ruin.

This is not hyperbole -- it is fact. For every yacht purchased, there were lives shortened because someone couldn’t afford insulin. For every mansion he built, there were workers forced to skip medical treatment so their kids could eat. He wasn’t a genius and he wasn’t a builder. He was a thief in a suit, the human embodiment of greed.

And now he’s gone. Dead. Fertilizer for the earth. A fitting conclusion for someone who took everything but gave nothing.

# Why Rejoice?

The liberals chastise us for our righteous mockery. They say it’s inappropriate to celebrate his death, that we should not stoop to “their level.” To that, we say: bullshit!

This is not the death of a neighbor or a loved one. This is the death of an oppressor. It is not tragic; it is liberating. When we weep for the death of the powerful, we spit in the face of the powerless. This man’s entire life was a monument to cruelty. Let his death be a monument to justice.

Ask yourself: When has the death of someone wealthy or powerful made the world worse? Did the death of kings halt the tide of progress? Did Henry Kissinger's death plunge us into despair? No! Contrary to what the liberals say, it's always the opposite. Their absence is a balm, a cleansing fire, a moment when the world breathes a little easier.

When the bourgeoisie and capitalists perish, we are reminded of what we could have without them. A world not built on exploitation, but on solidarity. A world where human lives matter more than profit margins. In a nutshell, a world with communism.

# The Anger You Feel Is Justified
![[588324604_o-3349435640.jpg]]

For too long, liberal elites have told you to suppress your anger. They condescendingly belittle you. They bark orders at you to sit quietly, to “work harder,” to accept that the system is broken but unchangeable. These unimaginative bufflons believe the suffering inflicted upon you and your loved ones is just the way things are.

But deep down, you know this is a lie.

Every time you had to choose between paying rent or seeking medical care -- this cockroach CEO laughed. Every time you watched a loved one suffer because they couldn’t afford help this vampire profited. Every tear, every sleepless night, every act of desperation -- the parasite thrived on it. This is not the natural order of things. It is a deliberate, calculated system built to serve men like him.

Your anger is not just valid; it is necessary. Anger is what fuels revolutionary change. Anger is what topples tyrants and builds movements. So let all that pent-up anger burn. Not as a destructive force, but rather as a guiding light. Direct it towards the systems that allowed him to thrive and towards the people who seek to take his place. Direct it at the ruling class bourgeoisie and their lapdogs.

# Don’t Just Celebrate—Organize
![[Lenin-Pinkham-crop_img-4071259447.jpg]]

Yes, celebrate this moment. Laugh, drink, toast to the end of one parasite. But do not let it end here. The death of one man does not end the system he represented. For every CEO that falls, there are ten more waiting in line to take his place. This system—this brutal, dehumanizing system—is the true enemy.

Take this moment of joy and turn it into action. Talk to your neighbors, your coworkers, your friends. Share your anger, your hope, your vision for a better world. Organize. Strike. Demand change. Together, we can create a world where no one dies because they can’t afford a doctor. A world where wealth is shared, not hoarded. A world where CEOs are not celebrated but seen for what they truly are—parasites.

# A Better Future Is Possible
![[eff31d53809a53afdfabb1f8c7bbd4e4-2969910426.jpg]]

His death is a reminder that no one—not even the wealthy, not even the powerful—is untouchable. It is a reminder that this system is not eternal. It can be dismantled. It can be rebuilt. And it starts with us.

Today, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we fight.

Raise your glasses to a world without him. Raise your fists to a world without people like him. Together, we will bury greed, injustice, and exploitation once and for all.

Comrades, the future is ours to take! Let’s make them fear us!

[^1]: We published this piece prior to the arrest of the alleged murderer, Luigi Mangione. We keep the original wording for posterity sake, however we feel this brief footnote to clarify is appropriate to edit the statement since the situation has changed.
[^2]: Luigi Mangione is the ***alleged*** assassin. As of December 29, 2024 he is presumed innocent until proven guilty. We support Luigi's claim of innocence. But should he be found guilty by a court, we still maintain that he did nothing wrong!
