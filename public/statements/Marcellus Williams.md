*Political prisoner Marcellus 'Khaliffa' Williams was lynched on September 24, 2024 by the AmeriKKKan state of Missouri*

Endorsed by [[2024-09-25-general-meeting|unanimous consent on September 25, 2024]]. 

Today, the state of Missouri - our neighbor to the East - lynched a Black man named Marcellus 'Khaliffa' Williams. Despite overwhelming evidence that  Williams was innocent, the white supremacist government ignored the demands of protestors, and even the prosecutor who wrongfully convicted him. The illegitimate and racist governor Michael Parson , as well as the Supreme Court, purposefully and intentionally chose to execute him anyways. The facts of the matter, the demands of the people, and the overwhelming evidence didn't amount to a single thing. The undemocratic and fascist nature of the Fourth American Reich was on full display. 

In the Fourth Reich, no amount of evidence can ever exonerate Black people if the state wants them dead. This lynching occurred despite an outpouring of popular support from all corners of the country. Every legal and peaceful option was utilized to attempt to overturn this wrongful conviction. The true, undemocratic nature of the white supremacist government was on full display tonight, almost as if to tell the people "nothing you do matters, so why even try?" 

This is nothing new for AmeriKKKa: it has a long history of incarcerating and lynching innocent people of all colors, but especially African-Americans. The Fourth American Reich was founded as a racist country and continues to uphold that legacy today. This is because the United States is built on a foundation of white supremacy.

Our book club extends its deepest sympathies to the Williams family in our neighboring state of Missouri. We stand not only with Khaliffa Williams, but with all African political prisoners warehoused in the modern-day plantations we call prison. Rest in power Marcellus Williams.
