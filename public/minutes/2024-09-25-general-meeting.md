	- ML label scared people away. Orthomarxists, Hegelian
	- Zach says we need the label. Lets not lie about what we're about.
- Ray felt blood in my eye starts off very scary, "mega doomer", very dark and grim. Blood in my Eye might hvae scared

# Notes
- Meeting begins at 9:45pm Central time. 
- Old Business
	- Flyers
	- Social Media: Facebook gets a lot of interaction. Instagram, not so much. Put out  educational
- Labor Requirements
	- Ray: Absentee status would be good.
	- Kaden: Inactive status is good. Labor requirements also good.
	- Zach: Inactive status is also good. But don't kick people out.
	- Percy: it's not intended as a punishment, just intended to give people space and make sure the org funs smoothly.
- Cde Alkemy as Provisional Instructor
	- They did not attend the meeting so we closed this topic. It may be reopened if they decide to attend a future meeting.
- Articles
	- Percy - Internal and external study. External is more ad-hoc and excerpts. Internal is for serious theory.
	- Kaden: Switching topics frequently. Good idea to have separate external study.
	- Ray: Material analysis of the news. Use the news channel for participation before hand. Encourage a discussion before hand - give everyone an opportunity to participate.
	- Kaden: Internal study can help us select the most important things and then we can read those.
	- Zach: Books are important still right?
	- Percy: Book pages count?
	- Ray: Look at 8th grade reading level homework assignments, try to assign more or less than many words.
	- Percy: We can invite the high motivation people into internal study if they want more.
- Marcellus Williams statement
	- Ray: The statement reminded me of George Jackson "Anyone who passes the civil service exam yetserday may kill me today" and "I live with repression every moment of my life, a repression so formidable, any movement on my part can only bring relief."
	- Kaden: Statement highlighted the absurdity of the colorblindness. Well written.

# Motions

	- Motion forward by Percy. Unanimous consent passes.
