## An Educational Pamphlet Written by the Cadre of the Kansas Socialist Book Club

Often times our society is lauded for how far we've progressed socially, but when we look around it really doesn't feel that way. So-called "alpha males" are all the rage among young men. Disgusting and sexist pigs like Andrew Tate are viewed by teenagers and boys as role models. Transgender people are subjected to the early stages of a genocide, and deviating from ones assigned gender at birth is being criminalized in many states. Just a few years ago Roe v Wade was rolled back, and uterus-bearing folks in many states now have to seek out clandestine abortions. For all this talk of social progress, it sure doesn't feel like it if you're a woman or you're queer! 

Why is this happening though? Why now, in 2024, are all these kinds of rights being rolled back? Is it just because the white men who write all the rules are really cranky and mean? Or is there a deeper reason for it? While we certainly won't deny that white cishet Christian legislators are rather unpleasant people, it would be wrong to simply chalk this up to a mean spirit or a fetish for cruelty. As Marxists, we understand that the world works based on **materialism** and not **idealism**. That is to say, material forces and relationships are the driving factors of history, not individual attitudes and prejudices. So what are the material forces behind his resurgence of patriarchy? Why now, at this specific time? And most importantly, what can we do to fight back against it?

# Systems of Oppression

We refer to the system of gender-based oppression as **patriarchy**. In our book club, we refer to the patriarchy as one of the ***four horsemen of fascism***. This is because there is an intimate connection between patriarchy, misogyny and fascism. As a special form of social oppression, **the patriarchy (like all forms of oppression) creates a class of exploited individuals for the purpose of transferring wealth from one group to another**. This is a very important distinction to make. When folks talk about oppression, there is a lot of confusion on the matter. Everyone uses this word, but nobody takes a moment to sit down and really ponder what exactly they mean by oppression. This is bad!

Notice how the way we've defined oppression is as a *transfer of wealth*. It's not about cruelty and a mean spirit, although it is quite true that oppressors are very cruel and mean people. So as Marxists who practice the science of **historical materialism**, we don't spend much time focusing on individual acts of misogyny or looking at individual bad actors (of which there are no shortage). Instead, we look at things in terms of **class** and **social relationships**. In that spirit, what makes something oppressive is that ***one group of people benefits from the relationship at the expense of the other***. In other words, the patriarchy isn't oppressive because it empowers individual men to be cruel. The patriarchy is oppressive because one group of people profits from its existence, at the expense of a different group.

# Feminism

Naturally, this raises the question of "Who is benefitting from the patriarchal social system? And who is harmed?" Many people, particularly those who identify as **feminists**, have spent a great deal of time trying to answer this question. What is a feminist? A feminist is simply ***someone who fights to eradicate gender oppression*.** In the Kansas Socialist Book Club, we uphold **materialist proletarian feminism** or prolefem. Prolefem is a feminist theory that incorporates Marxist class analysis into the specific issues of gender oppression. Prolefem views gender oppression as a unique and special case of broader class oppression. That's not to try to reduce gender oppression to an issue of class, but rather to point out the special ways in which gender oppression shapes class struggle. **Prolefem makes Marxism more scientific by incorporating gender into its theory, rather than trying to reduce gender to class.**

Feminism, just like Marxism or socialism or anarchism etc, has many different strains of thoughts and interpretations. There is liberal feminism, radical feminism, anarcha-feminism, and Black feminism just to name a few different strands. To discuss and contemplate them all would turn this pamphlet into a full-size encyclopedia. We recommend the book **Philosophical Trends in the Feminist Movement** by Comrade Anuradha Ghandy for those who want to learn more about different kinds of feminism. But these other forms of feminism all suffer from distinct theoretical errors. This is because they refuse to see how gender intersects with class, instead thinking of class and gender as separate phenomenon. They argue that the "contradiction" is between the oppressing class of males and the victim class of females. But this is a flawed analysis!

Notice the specific wording of how we've defined feminism. Nowhere in this wording do we say anything about women in particular. We also say nothing of men. This isn't because of an oversight on our part; the wording is quite intentional! But why? That's because some of the flawed theories of feminism, which try to reduce gender oppression to a struggle between cisgender women and everyone else. Gender oppression is a complicated thing. Take the example of white supremacy and its intersection with gender oppression. While it's certainly true that women are collectively oppressed by the patriarchy, what about the dynamics at play between white women and Black men? A crass and mechanical feminism would impulsively side with white women and argue they are oppressed, completely erasing the dynamics of white supremacy at play here. But history shows us that the opposite is often the case; that is, white women who are gender oppressed have historically been able to rely on their whiteness as a vector to exploit and kill Black men. Clearly then, Black men don't benefit from patriarchy to the same degree as white men do. Therefore, to simply reduce gender oppression to a binary of "Women Good, Men Bad" is unmaterialist, anti-scientific and historically wrong.

Framing feminism specifically as a women's issue is also transphobic. What about the unique struggles faced by transgender men, who are often subjected to 'corrective rape' by other men? Or what about the violence faced by gay men at the hands of other men? Does it make any sense to lump these different groups into the broad category of "oppressor class males"? Similarly, what about trans women? Trans women suffer from oppression at the hands of both cisgender men and women. Cisgender men view trans women as exotic sexual objects to fulfill their perverted fetishes, and often times will kill them after having their way. Cisgender women panic and gleefully cry wolf when trans women try to use a public restroom, weaponising their cisgender femininity to form a lynch mob. Surely, the case of trans women merits special consideration?

For these reasons, we choose to consciously use the phrasing "gender oppression" when defining patriarchy and feminism. We do this not to be "more woke", but because framing feminism as fundamentally about combatting gender chauvinism makes our analysis more scientific. It also, to be clear, still incorporates the struggles of all women!

# Who Profits From Patriarchy?

So far, we've laid out many examples of who suffers from and is exploited by gender oppression. But what about who benefits from it? As stated earlier, oppressors and oppressed people exist in a dialectic; one does not exist without the other. So if not men as a whole, then who exactly are the oppressors in this situation?

***The primary benefactors of the patriarchal social arrangement are always the ruling class of every society.*** Other groups benefit as well. For example, although a working class cisgender, heterosexual male might be exploited by his employer and therefore oppressed, it's also true that this cishet male still benefits from having a wife to care for his children while he goes to work. This cishet male worker also benefits from a legal system that values his word over the word of non-men in issues of domestic violence and sexual assault. Despite benefitting in this way, however, this worker is not the primary beneficiary of the patriarchal arrangement. His benefit can said to be ancillary.

The primary beneficiary of patriarchy is the ruling class, for a number of reasons which all tie back into class. Consider the gendered division of labor discussed previously. Traditionally, in a heterosexual relationship the man goes to work as the 'breadwinner' while the woman's role is to tend to the home and raise children. While the men in this scenario objectively do benefit from having women whose labor is subordinated to their needs, they are not the primary beneficiary. The group of people who benefit the most from this arrangement are the **bourgeoisie** - those who own the means of production. 

This is because as a class, the bourgeoisie derive their power and status from profiting off the labor of the Proletariat -- the working class. In order for the proletariat to be able to labor, however, they must be assured that their children are safe and cared for. If they were not assured of this fact, then most workers would opt to stay home with their children. And if workers consciously chose not to work, then the bourgeoisie would not profit!

But the bourgeoisie are a miserly bunch, and want to pinch pennies any way possible. If it were up to them, the ideal cost for labor would be a wage of $0/hour. Regular people call that **slavery**.  The tendency to drive down wages -- the cost of labor power as a commodity -- is one of the fundamental forces that drives the capitalist process. You could say it's like the gravity of capitalism.

Therefore, the bourgeoisie naturally want to pay as little as possible for reproductive labor. When we say reproductive, we aren't referring to sexual reproduction. ***By reproductive labor, we mean any form of labor which allows the proletariat to reproduce it's ability to go into work every day.*** Child reading and home making are two classic examples of reproductive labor. Education and nursing are other examples. And if we think about it for a second, we notice that all these examples of reproductive labor just so happens to be in professions that are traditionally viewed as feminine. They all also happen to be among the lowest paid in terms of wages. A housewife doesn't even earn compensation for her work! Is this a coincidence? Not at all.

This correlation between feminine coded forms of work, and lower wages is actually one of the more subtle but extremely important forms that patriarchy manifests itself in. And it is the primary way in which the bourgeoisie of all genders collectively benefit from the patriarchal social order. **The superstructural ideology of patriarchy creates the material conditions for the bourgeoisie to accumulate capital profitably.** Patriarchy is the reason why homemaking is viewed as women's work, and also the reason that work isn't paid any compensation. Female coded 

# The Fascist Connection

Fascism always rests on a foundation of misogyny and patriarchal values. As materialists, we want to investigate the **why** of this phenomenon. It's not simply because fascists are cruel, or mean, or get off on abuse. All of those things happen to be true, but those aren't materialist explanations. So what is the real reason that fascists are misogynistic?

The ultimate goal of all forms of fascism is to commit some form of genocide. This genocide serves a number of material purposes. Firstly, it fuels **accumulation by dispossession** IE growing rich from theft. The Holocaust was the largest material transfer of wealth in human history, second only to the trans Atlantic slave trade. Zionists are currently leveling Gaza as we speak to make room for Disney world resorts and settler real estate.

Secondly, genocide serves as a means to implement eugenics. Eugenics is the macabre bourgeois attempt to sculpt the labor poor. This is why we see fascists fretting so much about declining birth rates and interracial relationships. Because fascism is a fundamentally bourgeois philosophy and political movement, it follows that fascisms ultimate goal would be an attempt to sculpt the labor pool. It is similar to the dynamics of patriarchy in this regard.

What does misogyny have to do with all this? The answer is that **to a fascist, misogyny is the ultimate form of a security clearance.*** Although human nature is a pretty terrible idea, we think it's safe to say that most people generally aren't inclined to commit genocide. Doing genocide is a behavior and a conscious choice that must be cultivated, encouraged, educated and instilled into the genocidaires. This is why fascists are always sending their recruits to be indoctrinated into fascism through boot camps such as the police academy or military basic training.

But simply attending a military style boot camp doesn't necessarily mean you'll go off to do genocide. Especially in the earlier stages of fascism, when it's less mature and established, fascism much like socialism requires a vanguard. We know a great deal about how socialists identify and train our vanguard, but what about the vanguard of our class enemies? What are their methods?

The boot camp is one of those methods for fascists. But another method relies on a practical test to measure their commitment to brutality. If a fascist is to trust a recruit to commit the ultimate crime of genocide, then they need to prove their worth in battle. Misogyny and femicide are the perfect means by which fascists test their recruits. In this sense, **we can say that patriarchy and misogyny are vital assets to fascism because they serve as a concrete and observable metric by which fascists test the ideological commitment of their vanguard to domination and oppression.**

Why women in particular? It has to do with a numbers game. Fascism can emerge in any capitalist society. But these societies are wide and varied. For example, in Germany it was the Jews who were subjected to fascist violence. But in fascist Israel, it is the Jews who are the ones doing fascism (note: we ***are not*** saying all Jews are fascists here. We are acknowledging the reality that the fascist state of Israel is a Jewish ethnostate.) In America, the vanguard of fascism is Christian white men. In India, fascisms vanguard looks like Hindutva nationalists with brown skin. In Japan, the fascists are Japanese. It's safe to say that a fascist vanguard doesn't necessarily look or think all the same way.

Despite these various cultural differences, no matter which arrangement of culture, nation, race, ethnicity, etc happens to be present women will always make up about half of the population. And women will always be a significant group. Therefore, for fascist movements, the best predictor of if a member of the vanguard can carry out the task of genocide is to see if they can exercise brutality upon women. ***In this way we can say that misogyny functions as the security clearance of the fascist vanguard.*** In other words, if you can be trusted to beat women and oppressed them, then with a little bit of nudging in the right direction you can probably be trusted to staff a concentration camp.

# The Transgender Question

How does transgender identity play into misogyny and patriarchy? What are the material roots of transphobia? These are good questions to ask!

Recall our earlier conversation about the role that gender plays in dividing up labor. Reproductive labor falls upon heavily gendered lines. Careers and professions associated with care and reproductive labor are female-coded so as to generate consent for lower wages. The underlying edifice of this patriarchal division of labor rests on a rigid hierarchy of gender. In order for people to assume that every woman “naturally” wants to be a nurse or a teacher, it requires one to have an essentialist world view. In other words, it requires one to believe in the “natural essence” and innate properties of abstract socially constructed categories. Essentialism stands in opposition to the Marxist philosophy of dialectics. Dialectics, unlike essentialism, argues that all matter and things are in a constant state of change and flux. Dialectics teaches us that there is no “essential nature” of a thing. To quote a cliche, “The only constant in life is change.”

 It’s quite true that gender roles have varied widely over time. They also differ greatly depending on the cultural contexts. But it’s also true that despite these differences, each hegemonic culture to this point in human society has thought that it’s specific conception of gender was the One True and Essential Concept. What a gender role looks like is extremely varied, but once that variation is picked out, it tends to ossify into something static and unchanging.

The existence of transgender identity, therefore, represents a direct challenge to the hegemonic notion of gender essentialism. The logic of the fascist argues that if anyone can just wake up one day and decide they are a woman, then the rest of society will fall apart. They genuinely believe that trans people are some kind of degenerate aberration whose very existence seeks to undermine the western social order.

Let’s take a step back and ask ourselves “Well, what exactly is the foundation of western society?” As discussed above, the western social order -- which we can roughly map onto the concept of superstructure -- is one which complements and justifies the economic base of settler-colonial capitalism. And one of the foundational material pillars of settler-colonialism and capitalism is the exploitation of labor. In order for labor to be systemically exploited, reproductive labor in particular must be specifically devalued. And how does western society devalue it? Why, through none other than the ideology of gender!

So in a very odd and roundabout way, the fascists are correct: trans people’s very existence is a kind of threat to the hegemony of patriarchal, settler-colonial capitalism! They’re quite wrong, however, in that this is something which is bad.

It is quite true that the notion that your not born with a gender undermines hegemonic patriarchy. If any random person can choose to wake up and identify as whatever gender they want, then that absolutely calls into question the misogynistic and patriarchal foundations of the west. After all, if people wake up and realize this one day, then people might start questioning why nurses and school teachers get paid less than CEOs. And that would be an absolute disaster! Unlike the fascists, however, we personally know that this is a wonderful thing indeed! We encourage people to explore their gender and identify the way they feel most comfortable because they are actually slowly destroying the west when they do it!

But to the bourgeoisie and their fascist lapdogs, this is a travesty. Again, while we won’t deny that fascists as individuals are cruel and sadistic monsters who take great pleasure in their chauvinism, that’s not what makes them dangerous or socially harmful. What makes them and their disgusting ideas so dangerous is that they are the superstructural glue that binds together and stabilizes the foundational pillars of the material base. The exploitation of labor is built upon the foundation of the hyper-exploitation of reproductive labor. Gender liberation undermines the glue that allows that economic base to exploit. It represents a very important series of fissures in the foundation of captialism.

Therefore, we can now see the true material reason why there’s been such a transphobic resurgence in the past five or so years. The reason that fascists want to genocide our transgender sisters and brothers is effectively to stave off the declining rate of profit by way of keeping reproductive labor devalued. This is true, Marxist reason why transgender genocide is escalating and accelerating not only in Kansas, but across the United States.

# Conclusion

In our book club, we specifically believe that the nationally oppressed, the gender oppressed, and the disabled are those sections of the proletariat in the imperialist core who are structurally excluded as a class from becoming full members of the labor aristocracy. Therefore, we argue that workers within these oppressed social classes form a significant portion of the **revolutionary subject** -- the groups that have the most revolutionary potential -- in the US.  In this pamphlet, we have briefly explained our position on the specifics of why the gender oppressed in particular are good candidates for inclusion in the revoltionary subject.

An important note in closing is that although our analysis wrestles with the intersection between gender and labor, we vehemently deny our analysis as being a form of intersectionality. Intersectionality is a liberal theory that essentially says nothing but empty truths. "Oppressions overlap in distinct ways". While this may be a true sentence, it has about as much value as saying that water is wet! But the way it gets employed, as specifically described by its founder Kimberlé Crenshaw, is explicitly as a way to de-emphasize class. 

We want to be clear in that ***our book club doesn't view gender as this distinct category from class that intersects with it orthogonally. Rather, gender is a particular manifestation of social class with its own unique qualities***. We have briefly demonstrated why this is the case in our discussion about reproductive labor. We wish to make this distinction while also emphasizing that the opposite error of reducing everything crudely to class by assuming only white men who wear hard hats and work in a gizmo factory can be exploited is also chauvinistically flawed. It may seem pedantic, but it is actually an extremely important distinction to make.
