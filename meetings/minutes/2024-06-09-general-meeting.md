# Notes
- Do we want to have a branch system? Or do we want to just have separate clubs? Consensus is branch system works well.
- Cde Zach volunteers to run social media. Group consensus is that we use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for now. Mostly use it to advertise meeting locations -- stay out of shitposting.
- Flyers are a good way to advertise too. Need to remain simple and easy. Perhaps a QR code with link to the specific branches webpage.
- "Revolutionary Marxist Book Club" might scare folks off bc revolutionary. Cde Zach raises good point that "Revolutionary is implied by Marxism, Marxism alone won't get us cracked down on as much since we already have some attention on us, but it also signifies what we stand for." Cde Percy agrees.
- Tuesday evenings work best for Cde Zach's schedule. Cde Persephone is flexible with her schedule. Anytime after 5pm. Plan for two-hour long sessions.
- Cde Zach suggests 100 pages a week for reading. Cde Persephone warns based on her experience that might be a bit ambitious, suggests assigning no more than 40 pages a week maximum. Consensus is that 30-40 pages (depending on page length) a week is ideal. Hard upper limit of 40 pages.
- Group consensus that beginning of August gives us enough time to advertise, plan a curriculum, schedule meeting locations, and get prepared. Also aligns with influx of students returning for semester.
- Cde Persephone agrees she can fulfill role as secretary.
- Manhattan Branch should use study rooms of public library. Free, disability accessible, masks offered by library, built-in wifi for streaming lessons to discord, offers privacy.
- Consensus is that articles and excerpts from books work good. We can also read whole books but people will probably drop in and out. We can save books for when we try to induct more Organizers and expand the ranks of our cadre.
# Motions
- Motion to officially change the Kansas Socialist Book Club to adopt the [[bylaws]].
	- Raised by Cde Persephone, second by Cde Zach.
	- Motion voted affirmative by Cdes Zach and Persephone. Although they have a majority to pass the vote, given the importance of bylaws, the Comrades agree to table ratification of motion until Cde Nick can weigh in.
	- Cde Nick weighs in the next day June 20, 2024 with affirmative support.
	- Motion carries by a vote 3 in favor, 0 against.
- Motion to officially form a Manhattan Branch of Kansas Socialist Book Club which shall be called *Flint Hills Marxist Book Club.*
	- Raised by Cde Persephone, second by Cde Zach.
	- Motion carries by unanimous consent.
- Motion to appoint Zach as the Social Media Manager.
	- Raised by Cde Zach, seconded by Cde Persephone.
	- Motion carries by unanimous consent.
