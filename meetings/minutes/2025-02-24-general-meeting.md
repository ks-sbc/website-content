### Decisions Made

## 3.3 Brayden (Tycharis) Report

### Discussion point

- We need to be teaching people not only how to be a leader but also a follower.
- We need to develop professional and effective cadre. This is will depend on how we structure and eduacate our cadre.
- I envision a Cohort recruitment system to help develop teamwork and you can firehose info faster to people that way than you could with just one on one training. Similar to the buddy system or the Jedi order.
- We should also be teaching people how to teach and how to teach effectively to adults.
