## Self Criticism
- Percy: [[October 7th Rally]], Instagram/Social media professionalism
	- Social Media: 24 hours poll, no response = send it
- Zach: Feels they didn't put in the work. A lot of free time, but didn't contribute as much as they could.
	- Try to have sub-meetings even if they're informal
	- Having more social gatherings
- Nick: Feels like not putting enough effort into this group, focusing on YDSA too much.
## Criticism by Others
- Work towards having a graphic designer
# Agenda
## Old Business
- [x] Investigate more into social media educational content. Set up another meeting to talk about that.
- [x] Why are the bylaws: video series
	- Instagram stories: short form education. Deleted after 24 hours.
	- Normal posts (SC post on IG)
	- Reels and shorts (Video Content that stays up longer).
	- Reels help target more of an audience. Pushes out contents to non-followers.
	- Shorts are more for our already existing followers.
	- TikTok: 1-2 minutes max.
		- Zach is fine with running that.
	- 
- [x] TikTok explore.
- [x] Make meeting for social media in future.
- [x] Reassess how we conduct the classes to have the two tier model.
- [ ] Ray: Groceries for peanut butter scanning. Pringles. Stuff like that is good.
- [x] schedule meetings and reserve rooms after we learn the date (Monday Tuesday Friday)
- [x] Polling for times for LFK and MHK
- [x] Clean up the twitter
- [x] Work on implementing discord suggestions

# Notes
- Zach: Anti-Landlord sentiment is very popular even among reactionaries. We can correct this.
- Zach: Things that affect peoples life.
- Nick: Tenant organizing crucial. Education is first step.
- Maple: People sign up because they live in atrocious conditions. They want solutions. People are in such bad shape they're hungry for a radical solution. We shouldn't dumb down the message.
- Nick: Turnover of tenant organizing is difficult.
- What are some books or essay articles etc?
	- Fanshen
	- Stuff that calls into question the validity of landlord-tenant relationship. Not reformism.
- Nick: We already hammered this home with TikTok and IG. We need to find someone who is a dedicated graphic designer. We should pay them.
- Percy: I agree we should have a full time designer. But we shouldn't pay them. That can be labor requirements.
- Nick: Ideally we get someone full time who can dedicate time. But in the short run while we are small, we could pay someone as a temp position.
- Zach: Depends on the week. If I have money to afford, sure.
- Zach:  We need to find more dedicated organizers to ensure we can self-replicate. We can alternate who leads it. Try more people who are willing to lead.
- Percy: YDSA pipeline.
- Nick: KU starting to build YDSA chapter up. They are more of a liberal strand but that can be corrected. Build the pipeline more.
