4. Tasks

- Use our areas in our own investigations to determine what good practices are
	- Learn through practice
- From investigating our own location, derive the format from the concrete experience of locale.
- What general questions do we want to ask?
	- Look at historical examples
- How do we build questions off of that?
- 1997 MIM(P) class analysis of prisons
- [Outline of how to do SICA](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/qhHWqE0ft1xVkdyaJsuNwvkq/)
- [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_2.htm](Report of Peasant Investigation of Hunan)
- Houseless encampment work:
	- What are some specific questions? Not sure.
	- Need to figure out what would be helpful info
	- **There are many different viewpoints of the houseless, they are from different class backgrounds. The different backgrounds determine the political objective of the houseless person to counteract the basis of their oppression.**
		- Class background prior-to houselessness of person being interviewed should be recorded.
- What kind of mass work are you doing? That will affect the nature of the investigation.
	- Divide up work based on the nature of what we're doing.
- Resources we can use:
	- General/Universal
		- [Census American Community Service](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)
- Fundamental questions:  Questions that will always be asked regardless of the specific nature of the investigation.  
		- **Who is the enemy of revolution in our area?  
		- **Who are the friends of revolution?**  
		- Revolutionary Subject
- Natural and organic conversation can be used to gain insights into these things.
	- As you talk to people, they'll reveal tidbits of information.
	- Question examples:
		- What was the nature of your work, if you had any work?
		- Family situation?
	- When questioning, don't be too intrusive. People will naturally want to share things.
	- Let the conversation flow where it goes
	- Have consent to take notes
- There's no party sschool, no repository of knowledge, wasting a lot of time
- Movement is stuck in a hyper-local phase.
- Distilling down the relevant information that has strategic value.
	- How to relay this to other people in a way that is understandable
- If it's just us four, it won't work out bc of subjective biases etc.
- We have to build upon this based on our IRL connections.
- How Do Cities Form?
	- Give good historical context for SICA

## Purpose

NaN. From investigating our own location, derive the format for a template of building concrete experiences of locality.  
NaN. Get this to the point where we can finalize it, submit it to orgs/journals for criticism, and publish.  
NaN. Get this to be adapted as best practices in locality. Coordinate and help each other.  
NaN. Overcome hyper-locality  
NaN. Introducing these as tactics to people we already work with.  
	NaN. Have our comrades locally adopt these practices

## Goals

### Short Term

- Look at already conducted historical investigations to see how other groups have done it?
	- Peasant Societies in Hunan
	- MIM(P) 1997 Class Analysis
	- Danny
	- Kites Journal SICA article
	- KC based SICA (in chat group)
- Compile a list of resources that will assist every investigation in any locality
	- Census Data
	- ESL classes
		- Lots of different populations are being transferred. **If we can find demographic data about ESL classes to find immigrant communities**.
	- How Do City Forms?
