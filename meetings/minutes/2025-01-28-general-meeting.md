## Self Criticism

### Percy

Held bourgeois attitudes to book club in the past. Viewed it as a passion project and extension of personality. Caused me not to take steps to reproduce our capacity.  
	- I think we've taken good steps to remedy this with bylaws, labor requirement, delegating tasks.  
	- how do others feel? Suggestions?

### Trans Protection Party

Revolutionary group styled like the Black Panther Party. We are considering checking them out. Some comrades think they are identity reductionist and hostile to theory. Others see where they're coming from and they could be onto something with their concept (even if unintentional) of the Transgender Quasi-Nation.

We want to discuss and deliberate how to approach this group, if we should engage, and if so how?

We discussed previously that we would be open to it if:
- they're open to criticism and demonstrate a willingness to self criticism
- they are open to discussing class and perhaps discussing in a smaller group
- their values align with our own  
But, we simply don't know enough at the moment to tell. Need to do more investigation.

**Do we want to engage with them at Solidarity Fest to further investigate?**
