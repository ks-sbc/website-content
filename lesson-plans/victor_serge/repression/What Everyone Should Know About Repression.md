# Preface

The topic of police repression is one that's on everyone's mind. And a lot of people have a lot of confusions on it. We want to take this opportunity to clarify what we will ***not*** be discussing in this lesson:

1. How to get away with doing illegal activities
2. Specific tactics and techniques and tricks
3. Which encryption app you should use to talk to your comrades
4. In-depth technical analysis of police tools

You can find information about that on your own. As a political education group though, we want to stay focused on broader topics of a political nature. So her is the kind of things we will be discussing in this lesson:

1. What is the political function of the police?
2. What are their goals and aims regarding orgs like our own?
3. What are their strategies and methods they use to infiltrate us?
4. What kind of information do they want to get out of us?
5. How do we protect ourselves broadly speaking?
6. How do we structure our organizations to defend against them?

Victor Serge does talk about some specific tactics for example when he talks about evasive maneuvers to avoid surveillance. We won't really be discussing those. Not only are they outside the scope laid above, a lot of its also outdated. The cops don't always need to tail you that way, they just subpoena your Google Maps records and connect the dots on a computer.

Also, Serge wrote this over a hundred years ago. So while this isn't intended as a lesson in technology, technology nonetheless is relevant here. So we'll be adding some relevant high-level details about how policing has evolved in that way. But it'll be focused on politics and not on the nitty gritty details of how surveillance works at the level of data engineering.
