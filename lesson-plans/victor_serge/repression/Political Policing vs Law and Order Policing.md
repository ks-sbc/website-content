# The Two Types of Cops

When you heard the word "police", you probably think of your regular city cop with a uniform, badge, and a gun. They call themselves "Law Enforcement Officers". You might also think of an FBI agent with that iconic blue windbreaker and bold yellow lettering. These all get lumped together into the category "Cops". But is that really the best way to go about this? We would argue no, it is not the best way.

There are many different kinds of cops, but they fall into two categories. I wan to be clear here we're ***not*** talking about jurisdictional issues. In other words, when we say "different kinds of cops" we don't mean the FBI vs the DEA vs the BATFE etc. For our political concerns, the types of police are ***Law and Order Police*** and ***Political Police***.

# Law and Order (L&O) police

L&O cops are concerned primarily with enforcing laws. You speed in traffic, you get pulled over, cop writes you a ticket. Or your smoking a joint, cops sees you, arrests you. You sell drugs, you get raided by the cops. The pattern is: break a law, if cop sees you, get a ticket or arrested. And, of course, police brutality.

L&O police in the United States are also heavily miltarized. They view themselves as an occupation army, and they view the masses as subjects to control and ensure we don't break out too wildly. They have assault rifles, armored vehicles, helicopters, drone fleets, tanks, the works. Some L&O police like the NYPD (although they also have a political police branch we'll talk about) are larger than some countries armies!

But L&O cops play a secondary role as well. Your local and state troopers aren't exactly the brightest bulbs in the box. Many of them don't even require degrees, they just require police academy. The police academy is like a boot camp more than a education. They're conditioning you to become a warrior-cop. This is in contrast to political police, who often have advanced degrees in specialized subject areas. And yes, to answer your curiosity, [there are even cops who study Marxism](https://redsails.org/infiltration-incompetence-and-philosophy/)!

WHile your average city cop doesn't know the first thing about Marx, they do know about genuine signifiers. Both from common sense (A hammer and sickle most people know means Communism) as well as intelligence briefings and BOLOs[^1] for more specific things. These BOLOs are put together by political police. In the US context this is what a JTFF[^2] is. Most local departments have a JTTF. The Riley County Police Department does. The JTTF is the formal system by which local cops have a liaison with the FBI.

When they find indicators of "subversive activities" (Who are us communists trying to subvert? We certainly don't want to subvert the working class!) they will forward them to the political police, take an incident report, and archive this as an incident that can be tracked, compared, correlated, etc in some kind of database. One such database is called [eGuardian](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/freedom-of-information-privacy-act/department-of-justice-fbi-privacy-impact-assessments/eguardian-threat).

# Political Police

The political police are the ones we're truly worried about. L&O police will be commonly seen and can also show up for protests, demonstrations, etc. But usually they're not the ones trying to infiltrate us. That would be the political police. We'll talk more about their goals later, but for now, just understand that they want to infiltrate us to gather intelligence (actionable information).

Political Police aren't really concerned with the law. In fact, they themselves often break the law in the process of their jobs! Think of an undercover FBI agent trying to infiltrate a group. The agent is at a social gathering of comrades, and a joint is being passed around. Even though it's illegal in Kansas to smoke weed, the agent can still smoke the joint to try to blend in.

Agents can also function as provocateurs, providing organizers with things like bomb making instructions, supplying weapons, etc. That's illegal, but they'll still do it.

Even if an undercover political cop sees you doing a small crime, such as let's say smoking the joint discussed above, they won't bust you right then an dthere.  Don't get it confused: they absolutely could if they wanted to. But their goal isn't to lock you up on a weed charge and get you probation[^3]. Their goal is to ultimate dismantle an organization that poses a threat to the social order.

# Questions

1. If your comfortable discussing this, have you ever had experiences with the local cops? With the political cops? What was that like? (we won't take notes on this)
2. How does the average person think about the police? Do they think about it in the way described here? What are the similarities and differences?
	1. Law itself is politicized
	2. Certain ways of living are inherently criminalized IE homeless. Undocumented people.
	3. Some drugs are more legal than others. IE Cocaine powder vs freebase cocaine (crack)
	4. Policing is very racialized and born out of the slave patrol & subjugating African diaspora in the US context. During 2020, lot of liberal whites were saying "Defund the police" and other slogans. Two days later, if they were scared they'll call the police still. **The idea that the police are here to protect whiteness**.
	5. Black bodies are inherently criminalized. Even Black police kill Black people. 
	6. The Clintons weaponized the police even before he was president. Goes back to Reagan and is a consistent trend.
	7. Wha tdo we think of Black cops who oppress other BLack perople, Latino Border Patrol agents, etc? What is their function in white supremacism?
		1. The American identity itself is a white supremacist construct. It allows WS to mediate and smooth over the contradictions of racialized capitalism. It gives the colonized proximity to the in group without extending full privileges.
	8. Most people even at a university think the FBI is there to hunt serial killers and capture white collar criminals etc. But over the past decade, there's a growing consciousness of how laws are politicized.
	9. Origins in other countries are in the colonial occupation forces.
3. The FBI in particular is notorious for creating elaborate scenarios, finding people in conditions leading to instability, and then setting them up to have a big bust. Why do you think this happens? Examples?
	1. Chicago branch of the Black Panther Party was infiltrated by William O'Neill. O'Niell was very trusted, intimately knew Fred Hampton, gave his apartment layout to the cops, and betrayed them.
	2. Many reasons why they create these elaborate scenarios. The reason is relative to the group and the movement. We see them operating from right wing to left wing to Mafia orgs etc. In terms of Fred Hamptons assassination, creates internal discord. Creates paranoia. Destabilize the BPP. Whereas other situations, such as a Neo Nazi group, they will infiltrate them as well. Also the CIA operates in foreign countries.
	3. Gladio/Strategy of Tension to manufacture consent. Fomenting terrorism to rationalize enhanced control and build consent.
	4. A lot of our involvement comes down to the colonial notion of trying to "civilize" them and trying to exploit resources.
	5. Entrapment is to manufacture consent. IT builds their legitimacy because they were the big heroes. Builds up the paper tiger image that they are all knowing, all seeing, super competent.
	6. The feds end up having contradictions with the right wing over whether capital should serve white supremacy or white supremacy should serve capital
	7. Stereotype of unions being a mafia front vs reality. What is the reality?
		1. 
	8. Gladio relates to organized crime. Gladio represents consolidation of the CIAs power. It curated what the modern intelligence community looks like. Fall of the Nazis and Italian Fascists. **These groups were the world experts in anticommunism.** Dulles brothers recognized this and reorganize the rank and file of the fallen fascists in the stay-behind units. They wer organized into covert militia cells to defend against Soviet "aggression". This was funded by the drug trade of Heroin. This consolidated control over the drug  trade for funding covert ops. ***The line between the state and organized crime blurs***.
	9. *Drug Cartels Do not Exist* - Oswaldo Zavala
	10. We arbitrarily define the bourgeoisie into "illegal" and "legal" bourgeoisie.
	11. 2008 crisis - drug trafficking provided liquidity for global finance.
4. How should we factor in this knowledge of the police and their functions into our organizing?
	1. Street gangs are very well organized, disciplined, tapped intot heir communities. FreD Hampton got killed for trying to unite them.
	2. What is a healthy amount of paranoia looking like?
		1. You have to know how to identify feds, informants, infiltrators, etc. You need aprocess to get them out. But Fedjacketing can be weaponized to cause distrust.
	3. How do we develop an underground that has capacity to do what the above ground is capable of?

[^3]: It's worth noting that comrades who use drugs can open themselves up to police repression under the guise of drug laws, with the hopes of flipping them into an informant. But they also might just document what they see and let it slide for now so as to preserve their cover.
