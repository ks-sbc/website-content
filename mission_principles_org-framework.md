# Mission, Principles, and Organizational Framework

The Kansas Socialist Book Club (KSBC) is dedicated to the study and application of Decolonial Marxism. We approach revolutionary theory not as an academic exercise, but as a guide to action for changing society. Our organization draws particularly from the experiences of the Bolsheviks and the Communist Party of China during the Maoist period, while maintaining special emphasis on the study of contemporary national liberation movements - especially those on the periphery of empire.

## Theoretical Foundation

We recognize Decolonial Marxism as a living body of revolutionary theory and method, representing the culmination of revolutionary experience from the whole history of class struggle. Mao Zedong's contributions, particularly the Mass Line, the Cultural Revolution and the theory of Protracted People's War, represent crucial developments in revolutionary theory. We maintain an anti-revisionist stance, firmly disavowing all forms of revisionism, opportunism, and chauvinism. We therefore center the importance of revolutionary thought and class struggle in all aspects of our work.

## Core Principles

Our organization is guided by several fundamental principles:

1. The right to national self-determination for all peoples stands as a cornerstone of our work. We recognize that settler colonialism represents the principal contradiction in the United States, and that the struggle over Indigenous land sovereignty is of the utmost importance. Therefore, we pay particular attention to questions of national liberation in both our study and our practice. We support unconditionally the right of colonized peoples - to include Palestinians, Yemenis, Sudanese, Ema'Swati, Filipinos, Indians, the 500+ Indigenous nations within the borders of the Continental US, the Puerto Rican people, the Hawiian people, the people of Guam, the Inuit, as well as the Black nation of New Afrika - to conduct their liberation struggles as they see fit, while focusing our energy on understanding how we can best support these struggles from within the imperial core.

2. We express firm solidarity with the struggles of queers and gender minorities under the exploitative system of patriarchy. We affirm that queer oppression has its material roots in the exploitation of reproductive labor. We understand patriarchy as the oldest form of oppression, and recognize that queer and transgender liberation are inseparably bound with the feminist struggle. The specific strand of feminist thought adhered to in the KSBC is Proletarian Feminism. Within the specific context of Kansas, we acknowledge the ongoing genocide against Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming individuals, committing ourselves to studying and supporting queer and transgender liberation.

3. Our commitment to disability liberation manifests in both theory and practice. Disabled people in the US suffer from the material oppression of eugenics. Eugenics is the form of exploitation that arises from efforts by the bourgeoisie to standardize and regiment the pool of labor-power through a genocidal program of denying access to medicine and social Darwinism which are enforced through the prison system. We recognize disability liberation not as a moral crusade against 'ableism' so-called, but rather as a materialist struggle for liberation from the oppressive and exploitative social program of eugenics, which is enforced by the bourgeoisie for their profits. Furthermore, we affirm the real threat of COVID-19 as a mass disabling event and a means of population control through neglect. Combating COVID-19 is vital to revolution. Therefore, we implement concrete measures to ensure full participation of disabled comrades, including remote participation options and COVID-19 safety protocols at all indoor events.

4. We maintain an unwavering anti-imperialist stance, recognizing the parasitic relationship between the NATO bloc and the exploited global south. This parasitic relationship manifests itself in the form of unequal exchange. The materialist mechanic of unequal exchange creates two social classes which are mirror images of one another: the labor aristocracy and the lumpenproletariat. Given Kansas's special relationship with the US Armed Forces, we commit to studying how counterinsurgency methods developed and refined abroad are deployed domestically to neutralize revolutionary movements within the US. We acknowledge that this counterinsurgency methodology is the principal reason why the left in Kansas is weak, prone to opportunism, and unable to mount an effective resistance to the ascendant revanchist wing of the fascist movement in Kansas.

## Organizational Focus

While we currently operate primarily as a book club, our work lays the foundation for expanded mass work and a proper implementation of the mass line. We further uphold that any mass work undertaken must be done in a way not to smooth over the problems that arise from capitalism's contradictions, but must be done in a way that constantly pushes the masses in an increasingly revolutionary direction. Political education serves as our principal task through which we develop our broader organizational capabilities.

Our organization follows a structured development path:

1. Cadre Development
   - Systematic theoretical study.
   - Practical organizational skills.
   - Clear progression from candidate to full cadre status.
   - Regular assessment and improvement.

2. Mass Political Education
   - Making our lessons accessible without sacrificing theoretical rigor
   - Firm commitment to always arguing for a genuinely revolutionary theory.
   - Highlighting connections between abstract concepts of Marxist theory to the ordinary lived experience of workers and students.
   - Offering solidarity to other organizations based on a principled unity.
   - Creating an engaging public-facing curriculum that balances democratic values with ideological coherence.

3. Error Correction
   - Implementing a biannual assessment of common errors (Opportunism, Eclecticism, Tailism).
   - Offering our support for movement-wide improvement.
   - Consciously discrediting liberalism and highlighting any instances of it, even from other nominally Marxist organizations.
   - Being intentionally self-conscious of adopting a sectarian attitude as an over-correction to combating revisionism.

## Organizational Structure

We operate on democratic centralist principles, with political direction emerging from cadre deliberation while maintaining clear lines of authority in implementation. Our documentation maintains three levels:
- Theoretical documents establishing our principles
- Doctrinal materials guiding our methods
- Standard operating procedures for daily work

## Growth and Development

Our organization follows a deliberate growth trajectory, with established review points that trigger reassessment of our structure and practices. While maintaining political education as our principal task, we work toward expanding into other forms of mass work, always ensuring new initiatives strengthen rather than compromise our existing programs.

## Commitment to Accessibility

We maintain concrete commitments to accessibility:
- Remote participation options
- Mask requirements for indoor events
- Provision of masks to community members
- Accommodation of disability access needs in selection of public venues
- Offering educational services free-of-charge

Our success will be measured by our ability to develop effective cadre, provide accessible political education, and contribute to the advancement of revolutionary organization and consciousness in our region and beyond, while maintaining unwavering support for liberation struggles and practical commitment to our principles.
